FADE IN

EXT. AKEEN CITY, PLANET GULON II - HIGH NOON

We open to the cityscape of a vaguely Middle Eastern city. Sun-bleached brick slums dominate the majority of the frame, with impossibly high glass skyscapers in the background. As we pan over the cityscape, three militaristic spaceships fly past.

CUT TO:

EXT. SMALL MARKET, AKEEN SLUMS - CONTINUOUS

The ships land in the clearing of an abandoned open-air market in the slums. The ship doors open and soldiers with intimidating armored bodysuits storm out, heading down one of the cramped alleys.

CUT TO:

EXT. TENAMENT BUILDING, AKEEN SLUMS - CONTINUOUS

The soliders come to a door, surrounding it "SWAT" style. They breach and the camera follows as they clear room by room. Empty.

CUT TO:

INT. CREW SAFEHOUSE, AKEEN SLUMS - CONTINUOUS

From a second story window across the street, DORUN SHRIKE watches the raid. Specks of grey in his hair, he looks like he belongs in a classroom.

DORUN
We have to get off this planet.

Before anyone can answer, TARSIS enters the room. Close cropped hair, scars peppering his grizzled face. He closes the door, leaving it slightly ajar to keep watch.

TARSIS
We got out just in time. We're safe for now.

Hands clasped in front of him, ELLIS sits nearby deep in thought. Younger, well dressed, handsome if a bit naive.

ELLIS
Dorun, if they're raiding our safehouse it means-

DORUN
It means we have to get off this planet.

Pensively watching the scene below, EKELLE stands close to the window. Middle Eastern with a practical haircut and simple makeup.

EKELLE
This is a setback, yes, but you can't run now.

ELLIS
Ekelle is right. If we run now we trash months of work setting up to cripple the Empires' control on Gulon Two.

EKELLE
The Empire that took my family. The Resistance can help-

DORUN
The Empire has taken something from all of us. And we're not part of your Rebellion.

ELLIS
Do you know how much we'll be losing if we run now? Not even counting bribes, we'll be abandoning contacts its taken months to establish.

TARSIS
I'm finally making headway with my black market connections.

DORUN
None of which matters if we're dead. Look I don't want to run any more than you lot do, but we just got very lucky. I don't plan on being here when they connect the dots.

Dorun pulls a small handheld communicator out of his pocket.

DORUN
Arianne, get the ship ready. We're leaving.

CUT TO:

INT. SHIP: WINDSWIFT; COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Cables, tools and hardware are strewn about the run-down cockpit of the crews spaceship. A woman's head pops up from below the console, blonde hair a mess. ARIANNE looks like she hasn't been outside in a while.

Arianne curses as she tries to find the communicator amid the mess. Picking it up she attempts to sound calm and composed.

ARIANNE
Yes, Dorun. Right away.

She looks around at the mess.

ARIANNE
I'll get right on that...

DORUN
(From Communicator)
Have you been sleeping on the job?

ARIANNE
Excuse me? I haven't slept in days. I barely got the ignition coil working again and now the Nav console keeps losing power.

DORUN
You better not be breaking my ship.

ARIANNE
I'm the only reason this junker can even get off the ground.

ARIANNE flips several switches. A negative sounding "wump" responds.

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
Or not.

She tries again. Same negative "WUMP".

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
"WUMP"? You're not supposed to "WUMP". When I start primary ignition you go "DEE-DEE-DEEP".

ARIANNE taps at the panel looking for the issue.

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
It can't be the Nav causing this. We have enough fuel. Ignition coil OK. Oh. Oh that's not good.

CUT TO:

INT. CREW SAFEHOUSE, AKEEN SLUMS - SAME TIME

EKELLE
You said you would help us!

DORUN
I said I *could* help you, there's a difference.

ARIANNE
(From communicator)
Dorun, we have a problem. Something is blocking engine startup.

Beat

ARIANNE
All ships on the planet are affected.

Worried look shared by DORUN/ELLIS

ELLIS
Imperial Inhibitor Tech.

DORUN
The situation is worse than I thought.

EKELLE
What's going on?

ELLIS
The Empire has overridden control of all ships on the planet.

DORUN
Only authorized Imperial ships are able to fly.

EKELLE
That means-

DORUN
It means that the Empire knows all about your revolt.

EKELLE
That's not possible.

DORUN
Our safehouse gets raided the same day all ships on the planet are grounded? The Empire is making their move.

ELLIS
What do we do?

DORUN
What I've been saying all along. We have to get off this planet.

[ROLL TITLE CREDITS]

INT. AKEEN SLUMS SAFEHOUSE

DORUN
So we have a planet about to tear itself apart, a ship that can't fly, and the most dangerous troops in the galaxy between us and freedom. What do we do?

Silence.

DORUN
Well don't everyone speak at once.

TARSIS
Can we hack in and clear our ship for launch?

ELLIS
I have access codes that can get us into the Imperial Network.

DORUN
Too suspicious. They'll have cruisers patrolling, we'll be shot down before we get into orbit.

EKELLE
I have to warn the others.

TARSIS
I say we go in blasters blazing.

ELLIS
Tarsis, we won't get far if we just start shooting. *[To Dorun]* We still have those Imperial uniforms from the Ikketar job. We could get into the Restricted Zone without firing a shot.

TARSIS
Ellis, The last time we used those uniforms I nearly got blasted at the first checkpoint!

ELLIS
Well if you hadn't called him a drunken Telosin maybe it wouldn't have blown our cover!

EKELLE
We can help the Resistance but we have to act now!

DORUN
OI!

Everyone's attention snaps to Dorun

DORUN
We're not prepared to shoot our way in. Those uniforms will help us get through light security, but we won't get far with them. Tarsis, that means you get to shoot something today.

Tarsis looks pleased.

EKELLE
But the Resist-

DORUN
-Your Resistance can help us help them. I assume whatever plan you had for this uprising includes having flyable ships?

Ekelle reluctantly nods.

DORUN
Then taking down that Inhibitor helps us both.

TARSIS
So... what are we gonna do?

DORUN
Ekelle, get in contact with your people. Tell them if they want to be useful to meet us North of the Bazaar in one hour. We're going back to the ship to get ready.

ELLIS
Ready for what, exactly?

DORUN
The Empire's made their move, it's time we made ours.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SHIP: WINDSWIFT; MAIN ROOM
The main room of the Windswift is cramped and lived-in. A small cluttered table is to one side with a cylindrical console on the other. The two doors in the room lead to the Cargo Bay and the Cockpit. We see Dorun, uncomfortably dressed in an Imperial Officers uniform. Ellis across him is dressed in Imperial Troopers armor. They size each other up.

ELLIS
You look terrible.

DORUN
These uniforms never did fit me.

Enter Tarsis, also in Troopers uniform. He is heavily armed, comically so.

ELLIS
You must be joking.

TARSIS
What?

DORUN
One gun, Tarsis. You'll raise suspicion.

ELLIS
He'll raise hell.

Tarsis sniffs, but accepts. He pulls out the CAMO ENERGY SHIELD and SENSOR DISRUPTION MINE, laying the equipment out on the table.

TARSIS
(Petuently)
Fine, but I am bringing these. Camo energy shield, sensor disruption mine, and *this*.

Tarsis pulls out an UNKNOWN GRENADE.

ELLIS
What is it?

Tarsis holds the UNKNOWN GRENADE up with a childlike awe.

TARSIS
I have no idea. I got it off a arms dealer back on Ungvar Four.

ELLIS
And he didn't tell you what it was?

TARSIS
He... didn't get the chance.

ELLIS
You stole it.

Tarsis sputters thinking of a lie

DORUN
He stole it.

ELLIS ^
He stole it.

The door to the Cargo Bay opens. Ekelle enters with KURDEER, a Middle Eastern man, stubble on a shaved head revealing early on-set baldness. The trio give the newcomers "WTF" looks.

DORUN
How did you get on my ship? How did you even know where my ship was?

EKELLE
Perhaps you should give the Resistance more credit.

DORUN
We'll see about that. *[To Kurdeer]* I don't like strangers on my ship.

KURDEER
I am Kurdeer.

DORUN
Well Kurdeer you can call me Dor-

KURDEER
You are Dorun Pepsis Shrike, owner of the cargo freighter *Windswift* and the legitimate trading business you run from it. Of course, that's a front for the blackmarket and mercenary outfit you run.

DORUN
You know my middle name. Ellis didn't even know my middle name. Perhaps I *should* give your little rebellion more credit.

KURDEER
We know much, Captain Shrike-

DORUN
I'm no captain. Call me Dorun.

KURDEER
As you wish, Dorun. Although now that I see this ship, I do not think Windswift is an appropriate name.

Arianne enters from the opposite side doors.

ARIANNE
She's faster than she looks.

KURDEER
I doubt that.

Arianne eyes Kurdeer, taking the dig personally. Dorun shrugs, not as concerned of the state of his freighter.

KURDEER
Regardless, Ekelle has convinced me to meet with you.

TARSIS
Too late, the Empires already sprung their trap.

DORUN
I assume our safehouse wasn't the only one raided?

KURDEER
Many of our comrades have been captured. Our grounded ships are more concerning. Ekelle says you can help us.

DORUN
We can help each other. Come.

Dorun motions for everyone to gather around the cylindrical console opposite of the cluttered table. After punching a few buttons a 3D hologram appears suspended from the base of the console. The hologram shows 3D blueprints of a large facility. Different sections highlight in a loop, notes pointing to different rooms/sections.

DORUN
This is the Governor's Fortress. Since the Empire took control, this facility has become the center of government for the entire planet. If the Inhibitor is going to be anywhere, it will be here.

EKELLE
That facility is huge. The Inhibitor could be anywhere in there.

DORUN
An inhibitor this powerful is going to be large. Very large.

ELLIS
Also, it would have to be installed quite recently, or we would have seen the signs.

TARSIS
Is there any large construction efforts at the Fortress?

DORUN
I don't know. We could only get blueprints from the initial construction.

TARSIS
So we don't know about any changes since it was built. Great.

KURDEER
But *we* do. We have been watching the Fortress for some time. On the west side, here **[points to blueprint]**, an extension to the spaceport is underway.

EKELLE
Security is high there. Too high for simple construction.

DORUN
That's it. I think I might be impressed after all.

TARSIS
So how do we get in?

DORUN
*[To Kurdeer]* You're not going to like this.

Kurdeer eyes Dorun suspiciously.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. IMPERIAL INHIBITOR; GOVERNORS FORTRESS; PLANET GULON II

Open to see a commanding woman in a sharp Imperial uniform, long blonde hair pulled back in a severe ponytail. With an aura of absolute authority, Imperial Adjunct STEELA POLIS stands at a console, aides bustling around her. Hologram projections flank the Adjunct showing supply rates, troop positioning and other logistical information. She taps at the holograms, dismissing some, highlighting others.

She is in the Planetary Ship Inhibitor room, a cavernous hanger with a complex machine spanning the length of it. Engineers huddle near open compartments of the machine at various locations. A low, recurring "WUMP" sounds from the Inhibitor.

An Aide, HARPER, approaches with a holographic tablet in hand, saluting Steela. A young woman, brown hair in a simple bun. Attractive, but with tired eyes of someone working an endless, thankless job.

HARPER
You called for me, sir?

*[All superior officers are referred to as sir, regardless of gender]*

STEELA
Status Report.

HARPER
Planet-wide troop deployment is underway-

STEELA
How long until complete?

Harper stifles frustration, she was just about to say that.

HARPER
Under six hours, sir. The majority of deployments are complete.

STEELA
We don't move until all troops are in place. Everything must be perfect. This purge will end the Insurgency in one strike.

HARPER
Yes sir.

STEELA
What else?

HARPER
The Inhibitor is running sufficiently, but Engineering continues to report facily-wide system failures due to the power required to operate it.

STEELA
They'll have to deal with it. The Inhibitor stays up at all costs.

HARPER
Yes, sir. Also, raids against rebel safehouses are complete, but were less successful than projected.

STEELA
Explain.

HARPER
Many were empty by the time we got there.

Steela waits a beat, considering.

STEELA
Bad intel?

HARPER
We're interrogating our informants now, but it appears the targets were warned by an *outside* source.

Steela frowns.

STEELA
*[to herself]* There's an unknown variable here. *[To Harper]* Get me the raid debriefings. Something is off, we can't afford any surprises.

HARPER
Yes sir, right away sir.

Harper retreats. As she leaves through the door, GOVERNOR KASSUS enters. A belligerent man with a receding hairline and a glib demeanor.

GUARD
Atten-HUT!

Everyone snaps to attention, not Steela. She closes her eyes, gathering strength to deal with another distraction.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
Everyone out!

STEELA
Everyone stays.

Everyone in the room shifts uncomfortably. No one leaves. Kassus snarls, not used to be outranked. He stalks towards Steela.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
Do you have any idea the danger you've put us in? Your orders have put my entire defense force in disarray. Hell the Fortress is nearly undefended, rebels could walk right in!

Steela wait a long beat before answering. Aides and attendents in the room strain to appear uninterested.

STEELA
Kassus, you are simple, weak, coward.

Kassus face flushes, rage building. Seeing this, Steela's head of security, OTIB, steps forward. Dark skinned, shaved head, and a look of barely controlled rage. The look he gives Kassus prompts the Governor to regains control of his emotions.

Seeing herself in clear control of the encounter, Steela dismisses Otib with a lazy hand gesture. Otib steps back, unblinking eyes remaining on Kassus.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
*[tightly controlled]* I had hoped, Steela, we could have a civil discussion-

STEELA
You refer to me as Adjunct, Kassus. Imperial Adjunct. The only one on this backwards planet that outranks you.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
I am not disputing that, but I have several concerns-

STEELA
I am not disputing that, *sir*. You don't seem to be getting the point, Governor.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
Apologies... sir.

STEELA
Kassus, I hold full authority over this planet. Troops, supplies, even you. I could order you to the front line if I wanted to.

Kassus blanches at the prospect.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
You wouldn't dare!

STEELA
Try me.

Kassus waits before answering, his anger subsiding as he swallows his pride. He steels himself:

GOVERNOR KASSUS
With respect... Sir... It is my duty to raise concerns about your coming offensive. My... *Our* troops are stretched too thin. This Fortress is barely defended.

Steela considers. The deference is unmistakable, and she does respect him not backing down completely. Her tone lightens as she responds.

STEELA
Your concerns have been noted, Governor. The troops guarding this facility have been moved to help with the Purge. This Inhibitor protects the Fortress now. Without ships, no enemy can approach in force.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
And if the rebels do find a way to attack the fortress?

STEELA
Governor, attacking this Fortress would be a suicide mission.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
But-

STEELA
That is quite enough, Governor. You are dismissed.

Kassus nearly chokes at the abrupt dismissal.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
Yes, sir.

Kassus leaves, walking quickly while snapping at his attendents. Steela smiles, squashes it, and returns to her reports, all business.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CREW FREIGHTER: MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON

Establishing shot of the Windswift in a crowded public shipyard. Cut to inside the main room of the ship.

EKELLE
This is a suicide mission!

DORUN
It's the only way.

EKELLE
It's lunacy.

DORUN
It will work!

KURDEER
Let me get this straight. You want to us to march up to the Restricted Zone checkpoint and *get arrested*?

DORUN
Well, I'll be the one arresting you, but yeah that's the jist.

KURDEER
Who do you think you are?

DORUN
The only one on this planet that can get your ships off the ground.

A long beat. Kurdeer and Ekelle share a look.

EKELLE
We'll do it.

KURDEER
What? Ekelle! He cannot be trusted!

Kurdeer pulls Ekelle aside. A hushed, heated conversation ensues, words indistinguable. Body language shows Ekelle getting the upper hand. It's obvious they're "together". Ellis and Arianne share a look.

Kurdeer aquiesces, turns back to group.

KURDEER
Fine. We will be at the Bazaar as you ask. If this is some trick-

DORUN
It's not a trick. *[To Ekelle]* Thank you.

EKELLE
Tell me, truthfully. Will this work?

DORUN
It has to.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CHECKPOINT BAZAAR - LATE AFTERNOON

Open to show Dorun, Ellis, and Tarsis walking through an abandoned bazaar. Stalls are fully stocked, stray animals feast on unguarded foodstuffs, it looks like the area was abandoned in a hurry. The trio are on edge as they make their way through the bazaar.

TARSIS
Where is everyone?

ELLIS
People smell trouble. Only fools would be out here when the Empire cracks down.

TARSIS
Including us?

ELLIS
Especially us.

As they pass through the bazaar they nearly miss Ekelle and Kurdeer standing inconspicuously near one of the stalls.

EKELLE
Over here.

The trio spin nervously, raising their weapons.

KURDEER
I would ask you to not shoot us.

TARSIS
You scare me like that again I'll shoot you out of principle.

DORUN
Ekelle, Kurdeer. I do hope there will be more joining us?

EKELLE
You do not see them?

Ekelle motions with her hand. Several poorly dressed rebels appear from nowhere, evidently blended in with the area.

DORUN
Very good. Alright, my alias should get us through the checkpoint. With any luck, we'll walk right through.

ELLIS
And if we don't have any luck?

Dorun gives Ellis a look.

DORUN
We improvise. Tarsis, show them how it's done.

Tarsis takes on the demeanor of a drill sargeant.

TARSIS
MOVE IT YOU SLOVENLY LOT. I HAVEN'T SEEN A SADDER DISPLAY OF SLUMRATS IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. MOVE IT!

The rebel group is surprised, some taking offence.

TARSIS
*[Conspiratorially]* This won't work if it looks like you're going to jump me, put your heads down and play the part... AND IF I SEE SO MUCH AS A FINGER OUT OF PLACE I'LL PERSONALLY RIP YOUR THROAT OUT.

ELLIS
[Privately to Dorun] He enjoys this a bit too much...

The group, led by the Imperial-disguised crew march towards the checkpoint.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. RESTRICTED ZONE CHECKPOINT - LATE AFTERNOON

The group arrive near the end of the bazaar. Abruptly the bazaar ends and the scene opens up to a fortified military complex.

The "checkpoint" turns out to be very large gates surrounded by heavily armed soldiers. Watchtowers, gun nests, barbed wire, a small army defends the area. The gates are closed, guards dot the various watchtowers surrounding the area. A main guardhouse sit behind fortified heavy weaponry.

The disguised trio march the rebel group through to the checkpoint proper, a small outpost in front of the massive metal gates. Soldiers watch the group pass with a range of looks ranging from boredom to confusion to apathy.

Tarsis stops the group in front of the outpost.

TARSIS
HALT!

An imperial trooper rushes towards the crew. He salutes Dorun.

CHECKPOINT GUARD
Sir! Apologies sir, we do not have your arrival on the order sheet, Officer _____?

DORUN
(haughty, a bit forced)
Never mind, soldier. I assume our transport is ready.

Ellis and Tarsis share a look. "Really, that's your Officer voice?"

CHECKPOINT GUARD
Uhh... sorry sir... uhh... let me check with the Duty Officer.

Dorun shares a look with Ellis/Tarsis

DORUN
Very well.

The soldier turns away and calls it in. Ellis turns to his companions.

TARSIS
A lot of troops here for a simple checkpoint.

ELLIS
It must be a staging area for whatever the Empire has planned.

DORUN
This was a mistake.

TARSIS
Too late now.

The guard turns back to the group.

CHECKPOINT GUARD
One moment, the Officer is on his way.

A rotund officer steps out of the Checkpoints main office. Red cheeks snarl as he tucks his top into his trousers and marches towards the group. He barks some orders at some nearby troopers as he makes his way to the group.

CUT TO:

EXT. RESTRICTED ZONE CHECKPOINT - CONTINUOUS

Dorun sees the Officer heading his way. He turns quietly to Ellis.

DORUN
(quietly)
We have a problem. He outranks me.

Ellis doesn't have time to react as the officer reaches the group.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
What the hell is this?

Dorun snaps to attention.

DORUN
Sir. Junior Dominant Reese Karsor reporting.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Junior Dominant Reese Karsor what the hell are you doing at my checkpoint? And why the hell do you have these stinking slumrats with you?

Dorun looks at the rebels, seeing flashes of anger from the group he puts his hand on the officer's arm.

DORUN
(quietly, respectfully)
Perhaps sir, it would be best if we chatted in private.

The officer casts a look of disgust across the rebels

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Come.

The Officer leads Dorun his private office in the main guardhouse.

CUT TO:

INT. CHECKPOINT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The office is tastifully furnished. The warm, inviting room is decorated with cultural artifacts and emits a warm glow- stark contrast to the efficient functionality of the rest of the checkpoint. Hand-sized native statues stand on a cabinet on one of the walls. As the officer leans on his main desk, Dorun goes to the statues.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Well?

DORUN
These are original Gulonese ritual statues, aren't they?

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Cut the crap, Junior Dominant.

Dorun turns toward the Officer and leans back against the cabinet.

DORUN
Sir, my orders are to publicly arrest and transport those informants.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Informants?

DORUN
Yes sir, rebels considered assets by the Intelligence Division.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
If they're "assets" why arrest them?

DORUN
My guess, sir, is to maintain their cover.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Just like Intelligence to waste my time.

DORUN
Yes sir.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
So you've come to my checkpoint with a dozen rebels on some halfbaked plan to arrest them?

DORUN
Thats... Exactly right, sir.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Wasted effort. These Gulon's are cattle. I was posted at Hyrus Seven. Now *they* were something.

DORUN
I heard about Hyrus Seven. Violent.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
These fringe planets are all the same. Get the natives under the heel of your boot. Then squeeze.

Dorun shakes off the disgust. Checkpoint Officer frowns, smelling weakness. He shifts off the desk he was leaning against and shifts towards Dorun suspiciously.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
(menacingly)
Where are you stationed out of, Junior Dominant?

DORUN
(hesitant)
Central Planets... mostly... This is my first tour on the Outer Rim.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
You soft Centralites. That's what I hate. I've been out here for years.

DORUN
Yes... Sir-

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
I'm not finished! You Centralites are all the same. Cozy posts on safe planets, only coming out here to sniff out a promotion. I'm bringing civilization to these savages. What have you done?

DORUN
I'm just following orders, sir.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Well I'm giving you an order to get out of my sight!

DORUN
Sir... I'd be happy to, as soon as you give us a troop transport.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
(exploding)
WHAT? You think I'm going to give you one of MY transports?

The officer gets closer to Dorun.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
You impetuant little man. Do you have any idea who I am?

The officer is getting closer. A closeup shot shows Dorun's hand groping for one of the statues, his eyes remaining on the Officer. The officer is breathing down Dorun's neck.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
I'll have you buried Junior Dominant, you hear me, buried!

Dorun swings the statue across the head of the Officer in one smooth motion. He's dead before he hits the ground.

DORUN
Looks like you'll be the one getting buried.

Dorun rushes to the door, listening to see if anyone outside heard. Satisfied, he goes to the console on the main desk, authorizing a transport.

Task complete, Dorun moves to the Officer, taking a keycard and a communicator. He takes a moment to compose himself before leaving the office, closing the door behind him.

CUT TO:

EXT. RESTRICTED ZONE CHECKPOINT - CONTINUOUS

DORUN
The transport is being readied now.

Dorun moves to the checkpoint guard.

DORUN
The good officer says he's not to be disturbed. He didn't seem to be in a very good mood, I suggest you listen.

The guard is well aware of his Officer's temper.

CHECKPOINT GUARD
Yes sir.

The guard leaves and returns to his post, giving the order to open the gates. As the large doors open, Dorun returns to the group.

ELLIS
(quietly)
What happened?

DORUN
(quietly)
I improvised.

CUT TO:

EXT. CHECKPOINT LANDING PAD - CONTINOUS

Behind the gates a landing port for small ships sits with a number of troop transports. One is being prepped for launch. The group approaches the ship.

DORUN
We don't have much time. You still know how to fly those things right?

Dorun motions to the transport.

ELLIS
Well I'm no ace fighter pilot like Arianne, but I can fly it.

DORUN
You'll have to. We can't afford to land in the main spaceport. We won't be able to slip away.

ELLIS
So what do we do?

DORUN
What do *you* have to do? Deal with it.

Ellis blanches, but covers it up quickly. Dorun nods for Ellis to put the ruse back up as the group approaches the ship.

CUT TO:

EXT. TROOP TRANSPORT - CONTINUOUS

Ship technicians check the ship as the group approach. They ignore the group as they disconnect hoses and tap at diagnostic panels. Tarsis pushes the rebels towards the large main door of the transport.

TARSIS
Move it!

The rebels file in and Tarsis orders the doors to be closed. He joins Dorun and Ellis as they make their way towards the cockpit entrance.

CUT TO:

INT. TROOP TRANSPORT COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

The cockpit features four seats two by two, with the entrance to the rear of the cockpit. The pilot is in the left front seat, Ellis takes the seat beside him, Dorun and Tarsis sit in the backseats.

PILOT
Destination?

DORUN
Governor's Fortress.

PILOT
Strap in.

CUT TO:

EXT. TROOP TRANSPORT - CONTINUOUS

The ship technicians scatter before the ship takes off, turning in a smooth arc away from the landing pad.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TROOP TRANSPORT - EARLY EVENING

The transport flies in the air, breaking through light clouds.

CUT TO:

INT. TROOP TRANSPORT COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

We see an indifferent pilot, a self-conscious Ellis, an impatient looking Dorun, and a snoring Tarsis.

Ellis is quite busy not looking at Dorun. Fed up, Dorun leans forward and tugs Ellis' shoulder. Ellis gestures "who me?", Dorun "Get on with it". Ellis "Ok, ok, I'll do it.". Dorun "I'm watching you." All this without a sound.

ELLIS
Ah... We... We need you to land somewhere else.

PILOT
What are you talking about?

Dorun shoots Ellis with a "Not good enough" expression. Ellis considers his options. He moves to speak again, but stops before saying anything. He grows frustrated, then realizes what he's going to do. He looks to Dorun, then the Pilot.

ELLIS
Sorry about this.

PILOT
What?

Ellis punches the Pilot hard, then brings his hand back and shakes it off, realizing the stupidity of punching a man with a helmet on in the head. The Pilot looks at Ellis confused. Seeing his gambit failing, Ellis punches the Pilot again, this time on the jaw.

The punch is enough to lurch the transport, a quick camera shot in the main compartment shows the rebels falling over with the unexpected shift in direction. Tarsis wakes abruptly.

TARSIS
(half-dreaming)
What? Aww yeah GUT HIM!

The Pilot tries to grab Ellis, who attempts to strike the pilot again. The Pilot fends off the attack, getting a decent hold on Ellis and pulling him down. From his viewpoint, Ellis sees a red "Eject" lever on the pilots chair.  Ellis breaks from the Pilots grip, strikes again, then puts both hands on the lever. The pilot looks down, realizing what Ellis is going to do. He looks back up to Ellis.

PILOT
(sad and scared)
Please no.

ELLIS
I said I was sorry.

Ellis pulls the lever. The Pilots chair explodes laterally from his side of the ship with awesome force. The other seats are unaffected, and Ellis flails to catch his grip. The room roars as air rushes in the cockpit.

Ellis manages to get back into his seat, and stuggles to get the ship back under control. The ship is roaring with a rising pitch like a WWII dive bomber. Pulling up, he finally gets the ship back on course and puts on the comm helmet.

CUT TO:

INT. FLIGHT CONTROL CENTER, GOVERNORS FORTRESS - CONTINUOUS

Flight Control isn't a hard job, mostly tedious, but the last several weeks have been particular bad with long days and few breaks. The message that a Troop Transport has just had an ejection event sparks mild interest in an otherwise exhausted Flight Controller.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Transport Three-Seven-Two this is Flight Control. We just detected an ejection event on your ship, please respond.

[Intercut between Flight Control Interior and Transport Cockpit Interior]

Ellis is startled, not exactly sure what to do.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
I say again, we've detected someone ejecting from your ship. Please respond.

ELLIS
Uh... Everything is fine here, I don't know what you're talking about.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Transport Three-Seven-Two your ship has clearly logged an ejection event. You're also showing significant yaw drag.

ELLIS
No, no ejection here. Your sensors must be off.

The Flight Controller scoffs.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Our sensors are working just fine. You-

ELLIS
Look I don't know what to tell you. I would know if someone ejected.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Your ship must be logging bad flight data.

Ellis struggles at the controls, the ejection hole has produced significant drag.

ELLIS
If you say so, she's running smooth on my end.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Transport Three-Seven-Two you're hereby ordered to Shipyard B-Nine-Alpha for immediate diagnostics and repair.

ELLIS
Oh kay.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Transport Three-Seven-Two correct your flight trajectory to Shipyard-

ELLIS
I have, your sensors must be off again.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Why I have never- Transport Three-Seven-Two I will have you written up so fast-

Ellis pulls off the helmet. As he speaks he alternates the helmet from close to far from his mouth.

ELLIS
Sorry... breaking up... Can't... hear you.

Ellis tosses the helmet out the ejection hole.

DORUN
What the hell was that?

ELLIS
Improvising.

Dorun looks towards Tarsis, who nods his head agreeably.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. IMPERIAL INHIBITOR; GOVERNORS FORTRESS - EARLY EVENING

Steela continues to sift through her hologram reports. She appears more stressed than before. Harper approaches.

HARPER
Sir, you asked to be alerted if there was any odd reports?

STEELA
Yes?

HARPER
A transport has gone AWOL.

STEELA
Oh?

HARPER
We're attempting to determine the cause, it looks like equipment malfunction.

STEELA
Where is the transport headed?

HARPER
At it's current course it will arrive here in minutes.

STEELA
Continue monitoring the transport, and find out where it came from.

HARPER
Already on it, sir.

Steela dismisses Harper with a hand wave. As Harper leaves, she puts a hand to her ear as she receives a report. She frowns, realizes the relevance of the report and looks to Steela. She approaches Steela again.

HARPER
Sir, the transport was found to come from a checkpoint near the grand bazaar. The officer who ordered the transport has been found dead. It can't be coincedence.

STEELA
Agreed.

HARPER
I'll alert the Fortress Defenses.

STEELA
Wait.

She closes her eyes, doing the math in her head.

STEELA
I won't give that sniffling Governor the satisfaction of knowing he was right. Otib, take your men and deal with it.

OTIB
Yes, sir.

Otib gathers his troops with a hand gesture and leaves in a hurry.

STEELA
Harper, are troop deployments completed.

HARPER
Not yet, sir.

STEELA
This purge can end the resistance on this planet tonight. We need those troops in place before we can start.

CUT TO:

INT. TROOP TRANSPORT - EARLY EVENING

ELLIS
There it is.

CUT TO:

EXT. GOVERNORS FORTRESS - CONTINUOUS

The ship breaks through the clouds and reveals the magnitude of the Governors Fortress. With a length and width that measure in kilometers, the Fortress is massive.

Near the west side construction is underway, and ships buzz to and fro from the Fortress as bees from a hive. The transport speeds towards its destination.

CUT TO:

INT. TROOP TRANSPORT - CONTINUOUS

DORUN
There, you can see the construction on the west side.

TARSIS
We can't fly right in, security will be too high.

ELLIS
He's right. Looks like there's an empty service bay just outside the construction zone.

DORUN
Do it.

CUT TO:

EXT. LANDING SITE; GOVERNORS FORTRESS - CONTINUOUS

The landing site turns out to be a minor service bay for the major construction effort underway on the Fortress. While outside the construction zone proper, is littered with construction equipment, open panels and other errata.

Usually used as a shortcut for providing/retrieving equipment, the area is currently empty. Two large service doors are closed beside a small console coloured with distinct red "no entry" message.

The edge of the landing site is a sheer dropoff, a small outcropping on the massive structure.

The ship lands, a bit sloppily, and the main doors open. Dorun and the others meet with the shaken group of rebels.

EKELLE
Who the hell was flying that thing.

ELLIS
It's harder than it looks.

DORUN
Kurdeer, get your men behind cover. Tarsis, go with them. We'll have company soon enough. Ellis, let's get this door open.

The rebels spread out, taking cover near equipment and the transport. Dorun and Ellis run to the console. It's mostly red, with bright letters stating "AUTHORIZED ACCESS ONLY"

ELLIS
Can you get in?

Dorun taps at the console, entering an authorization code. "ACCESS DENIED" responds.

DORUN
My access code isn't good enough.

ELLIS
Let me try.

Ellis takes over at the console. He taps for a bit, then reaches behind the console between the panel and the wall. Something short-circuits and the console goes black.

DORUN
What did you do?

ELLIS
Just hold on.

The console sputters to life. Instead of the brightly colored graphical interface seen before, a much more primitive terminal spews text. Ellis taps at the console.

DORUN
Hurry up.

ELLIS
Hold on, hold on.

DORUN
We don't have much time!

ELLIS
Would you let me concentrate? Just have to reroute power and...

Sirens start blaring as an alarm is tripped. Dorun and Ellis take a moment looking to look at each other.

DORUN
Did you just trip the alarm?

ELLIS
I don't know, that should have worked!

DORUN
Did you just trip that alarm?

ELLIS
Well maybe if you had let me concentrate.

DORUN
I gave you one job.

ELLIS
What? You've given me like seventeen jobs, and pile more on before I can finish any. You don't show me any respect, you micromanage everything, and I always get the smallest room!

DORUN
Really, you want to have this conversation now?

Tarsis approaches.

TARSIS
What the hell is going on here?

DORUN
Ellis is dissatified with my management decisions.

TARSIS
What does that even mean? You know what, I don't care.

Tarsis shoots the wailing siren, it stops.

TARSIS
We're sitting ducks out here.

Suddenly several troops, led by Otib, burst forth from around the corner. Blasters fire and several rebels go down.

TARSIS
INCOMING!

Tarsis pushes Ellis towards some construction equipment and follows, shielding Dorun like a bodyguard as he follows. Both the rebels and the crew are pinned down by the supressing fire.

Tarsis look past the cover, takes aim and fires. A trooper goes down. The rest of the troops scramble to get to cover themselves.

Otib slides towards some cover. While Imperial Troopers and Rebels exchange fire, Otib takes out a small sphere. He presses a button on it then throws it in the air above him. Mid-air, the device snaps open along its seams, revealing a small jet and a camera.

Otib expands a holographic screen from his wristband. We see the flying devices camera perspective on the screen. From it's vantage we see the rebels and crew fighting. Enemies become highlighted in red, able to be seen even behind cover.

Pleased, Otib closes the tablet. On the back of head we see a helmet base (as part of his armor), Otib presses a button on the helmet and it expands to cover his face. Once fully covered, Otib looks towards the rebels. From his perspective, we see that he sees the red highlighted enemy generated by the flying device.

OTIB
You won't be getting away from me.

Otib fires. With his extended vision he's able to hit several rebels. Other rebels stop firing back, once again pinned by the troopers fire.

Tarsis sees the rebels go down. He looks at Dorun and Ellis, also trying to stay out of the line of fire. Expression firming with resolve, he jumps out from his cover. He fires while running towards the transport.

DORUN
Cover him!

As Tarsis charges, Dorun and Ellis lean out from their cover to help lay down supressing fire, giving Tarsis a chance.

Tarsis makes it to the transport. He gets in and quickly turns the ship on. We see the transport hover, then turn towards the enemy troops.

ELLIS
What the hell is he doing?

We see Tarsis push the acceleration level all the way, then jump out of the ejection hole, rolling into a crouch. The transport speeds toward the enemy troops, who scramble to get out of the way. We see Otib realize whats coming and barely jump out of the way of the oncoming ship.

This ship takes out a few troopers, then continues to fly past. We follow the transport as it arcs towards a far tower on the Fortress. It collides in a massive exposion.

CUT TO:

INT. GOVERNORS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Governor Kassus sits at his desk tapping at holographic reports. The building shakes around him as he holds of for dear life. The shaking stops.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
What the hell is going on?

He points to a confused attendent.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
Find out what happened. Quickly man.

CUT TO:

EXT. LANDING SITE - CONTINUOUS

Tarsis and the rebels continue shooting, several Troopers going down. We see Otib nearly get hit.

OTIB
Fall back! With me!

The troopers follow Otib, firing as they retreat around the corner they had originally come from.

DORUN
We need to get those doors open! They'll be back with reinforcements.

The crew and the rebels huddle by the door. Ellis taps at the console. He throws up his hands in futility. Suddenly, with no one touching the console, it lights up in a bright green color showing the words "ACCESS GRANTED". The doors open.

ELLIS
I... I didn't do that.

EKELLE
No time for standing around.

DORUN
Get in!

The group files into the Fortress proper. Tarsis keeps an eye out as everyone files in, before bringing up the rear. Tarsis takes out the SENSOR DISRUPTION MINE, activates it, and tosses it behind him.

TARSIS
This will hide our a tracks for a while.

From Otib's perspective, we see he sees the red outlined rebels are in the building from his vantage point.

OTIB
They've gotten in, follow me!

Otib charges around the corner and after the rebels. As he reaches the SENSOR DISRUPTION MINE an electric shock bursts forth. The troops squirm in pain momentarily. We see the red outlined targets Otib could see are gone. Otib deactivates his helmet.

OTIB
Damn!

INT. IHIBITOR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Harper quickly approaches Steela.

HARPER
Sir, the transport we were tracking has collided-

STEELA
I know, Otib has failed to prevent the rebels from getting into the Fortress.

HARPER
What do we do?

STEELA
Order all remaining guards to rally here. The Inhibitor must be protected at all costs.

HARPER
Yes sir.

STEELA
And order the Purge to start.

HARPER
It's too early-

STEELA
Early be damned! We need to take back the inititave.

HARPER
Yes sir.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ACCESS TUNNELS; GOVERNORS FORTRESS - EVENING

The crew and rebels enter a junction room with hallways leading in several different directions. They stop, unsure of which direction to choose.

EKELLE
Where do we go?

ELLIS
Where are we?

KURDEER
Bad time to get lost.

TARSIS
They won't be far behind, we need to move.

Dorun pulls up the holographic Fortress Blueprint from his wristband. Several levels zoom in to find the exact floorplan of their location.

DORUN
We're close to a small armory. They should have explosives. We get the explosives, blow up the Inhibitor, get back to the ship and off this planet.

All eyes are on Dorun as he starts down one of the hallways.

DORUN
This way.

All eyes continue to follow as he turns around and heads for the exact opposite hallway.

DORUN
This way.

The others share an amused look before falling in after Dorun.

CUT TO:

INT. GOVERNORS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

An attendant apporaches the Governor. No longer sitting, Kassus leans over the desk imposing.

ATTENDANT
Sir, the Fortress is under attack.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
I knew it.

ATTENDENT
Insurgents are responsible for the explosion and we've confirmed they've penetrated the fortress.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
How many?

ATTENDENT
Unknown, sir. The Imperial Adjunct sent her personal guard, who lost them. Officially our orders are to rally at the Inhibitor.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
What? We should be hunting the enemy, not cowering as the enemy let's loose in my Fortress. As if the Inhibitor is the only thing here worth defending.

The Governor raps the table, coming to a decision.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
It's time I paid the Adjunct another visit. She's over-extended herself.

The Governor moves to exit.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
With me!

Attendants and troopers fall in behind the Governor as he confidently strides out the room.

CUT TO:

INT. ARMORY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Dorun carefully looks around a corner. Two guards flank a door marked "ARMORY". Dorun turns back to the group.

DORUN
Tarsis, Ellis, you're with me. We'll deal with the guards. The rest of you follow.

The three round the corner, Dorun in front with Tarsis and Ellis flanking him. Dorun looks imperious in the officers uniform. The two guards snap to attention.

DORUN
Any trouble here?

GUARD 1
No sir.

GAURD 2 ^
No sir.

DORUN
You're in trouble now.

The guards looks confused. Ellis and Tarsis take the butt of their blaster and knock the guards out.

DORUN
We're in!

The rebels follow down the hallway and the group enter the armory.

INT. ARMORY - CONTINUOUS

The armory contains rows of blasters, grenades, armor and explosive devices. The group wander slightly awed by the display. Tarsis rounds a corner and squee's in excitement.

TARSIS
It's so beautiful.

The camera reveals the object of Tarsis's delight. A large HEAVY REPEATER with attached backpack. Tarsis puts it on, laughing manically. Dorun and Ekelle share a look.

EKELLE
I wonder what he's compensating for.

Dorun laughes, shaking his head.

DORUN
There must be explosives here.

ELLIS
Over here!

Ellis inspects a rack of small square explosives.

DORUN
That'll do the trick. All of them.

Dorun opens a bag and starts pulling explosives into it. The others follow suit. While doing this, a small grenade scatters across the floor through the armory entrance.

KURDEER
GET DOWN!

The bright light of a flashbang explodes in the room. Blinding white light, the room ringing with burst eardrums, words and noises subdued momentarily as imperial troopers charge through the armory entrance. Tarsis is the first to react.

TARSIS
Oh no you don't.

Tarsis sets himself in a strong stance and pulls the trigger of the HEAVY REPEATER. The violent rate of fire is remarkable as troopers fly back from the force. Large rents in their armor is seen as they get hit with ship-grade laser fire. Weapon racks and other objects are torn asunder as the weapon rips the room apart.

TARSIS
WHOOO! WHOOO! GET SOME! GET SOOOOME!

The HEAVY REPEATER finally goes quiet, even though Tarsis still has his finger on the trigger. A message on the gun stock blinks "CHARGE DEPLETED". Tarsis' disappointment is clear. Laser fire resumes from the armory entrance and Tarsis jumps for cover, pulling the large weapon off.

DORUN
Feel better?

TARSIS
That was magical.

ELLIS
Well I hope you enjoyed it, because we're trapped.

EKELLE
That's the only entrance to the armory.

Laser fire from the troops outside makes it impossible to approach. Rebels take potshots out the door.

DORUN
But it's not the only exit.

The three look to Dorun confused. Dorun takes out the explosives.

DORUN
Take these and place them around the room.

The three carefully place the explosives along the edges of the room. They meet back together.

DORUN
This is going to be loud and painful. Do it.

Ellis tosses a bag of explosives out the door. A large explosion is seen as laser fire hit the bag.

DORUN
Everyone in the middle of the room!

Rebels and the crew huddle together in the middle of the room. Dorun closes his eyes.

DORUN
Hold on!

Dorun presses the small trigger in his hand. The room around them explodes. The explosives blow holes in the floor and the floor below the group falls to the level below. Dust and debris scatter as the group picks themselves up from the rubble.

CUT TO:

INT. ARMORY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Otib pulls himself from the floor, shaking off debris. He looks around at the dead and injured troopers around him. Other troopers also pick themselves up and check on thier injured comrades.

OTIB
This prey is clever.

Otib walks up to the entrance, which is deformed and covered with large debis.

OTIB
Fall in. We will not allow them slip away again.

Otib jogs down the hallway in search of his prey. Troopers fall in behind him.

CUT TO:

INT. ARMORY REMAINS - CONTINUOUS

Dust covered and dazed, the group gets up, patting themselves off and checking for wounds.

DORUN
Everyone OK?

TARSIS
Ellis isn't.

ELLIS
What?

Ellis's armor is clearly ripped.

ELLIS
Good thing I was just borrowing this.

EKELLE
Where are we?

DORUN
Good question.

Dorun pulls up the blueprint, searching for their current position.

DORUN
Hmm. There's a detention center that way.

Dorun point down a hallway.

DORUN
But the Inhibitor is this way.

Dorun points to the other direction.

KURDEER
We're close to the prison? Our comrades are there.

EKELLE
We must free them.

Dorun thinks for a moment, then nods.

DORUN
Go. We'll destroy the Inhibitor.

Dorun points to a section of the blueprint.

DORUN
There's a small landing bay here. We'll meet you there once the Inhibitor is down.

ELLIS
Let's go.

DORUN
Not you. We need to blend in, your armor is a dead giveaway.

ELLIS
You can't-

DORUN
Ellis, we don't have time. Go with them, they'll need your help.

ELLIS
What about you?

Dorun pauses. He doesn't like this.

DORUN
We'll muddle through.

It pains him, but Ellis accepts the logic.

ELLIS
We better get to it then.

DORUN
Remember, if anything goes wrong, improvise.

Ellis smiles, then turns towards the rebels.

ELLIS
We don't have much time. Come on!

The rebels leave, leaving Dorun and Tarsis alone.

TARSIS
I'm surprised we've made it this far.

DORUN
Let's go.

The two head in the other direction.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. INHIBITOR ROOM - EVENING

Kassus enters the room imperiously. Attendents and aides flanking him.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
Imperial Adjunct.

Steela looks up from her console.

STEELA
(cooly)
Governor.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
I can only assume that your mishandling of this situation is due to your inability to accept I was right.

STEELA
The situation is under control.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
Adjunct, I am shocked how out of control the situation has become. Insurgents able to infiltrate our defenses, explosives ripping the Fortress apart, and what few troopers we have defending the wrong target.

STEELA
The Inhibitor must be the target!

GOVERNOR KASSUS
Adjunct, please. Their target is the prison. It has been all along.

STEELA
How would they escape even if they did free the prisoners?

GOVERNOR KASSUS
You give these rebels too much credit. They are a simple people with simple motivations.

STEELA
They've been quite effective for "simple people".

GOVERNOR KASSUS
Yes, Adjunct. They have. Something I intend to put a stop to right now.

The Governor steps away and addresses the troops in the room.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
ATTEN-HUT!

The troops snap to attention.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
(speaking to room)
Enemies of the state have attacked us. As we speak they are infiltrating the detention center, and if successful, will release some of the most dangerous enemies on the planet. I am going to stop them. Anyone who values the careful peace we have brought to Gulon Two is welcome to join me, else show your true colors.

Troopers look uneasily at each other, then to Steela.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
Now, who's with me.

Nothing at first. Then, a brutal-faced veteren steps forward.

VETEREN
I'm with you, SIR. And so is everyone else.

Kassus looks at Steela, daring her to overrule him. Steela holds his gaze, calculating. She relents, assenting with a hand wave. Kassus looks supremely pleased as he turns.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
Do not stop until we have killed every one of them.

The veteren smiles as the troops form up.

VETEREN
On me!

The troops file out. Kassus eyes Steela as the troops pass. Steela folds her arms, not giving Kassus a thing. As the last of the troops file out, Kassus gives a triumphant chin raise as he follows. Alone, Steela grabs a communicator from her workdesk.

STEELA
Otib, get back to the Inhibitor room. Now.

CUT TO:

INT. GOVERNORS FORTRESS HALLWAY 1 - CONTINUOUS

OTIB
Yes, Adjunct. On my way.

Otib puts down the communicator. He flashes to rage, punching and breaking a nearby door console. His squad backs away slightly, well versed in his violent outbreaks- not so much to draw attention, but enough to not be within striking distance. Otib returns to normal as quickly as he exploded. Without a word or a look to his squad, he turns around to head back to the Inhibitor Room.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GOVERNORS FORTRESS HALLWAY 2 - CONTINUOUS

Dorun and Tarsis walk down the corridor rigidly. Troops, officers, and various staff walk by without giving the two any notice.

TARSIS
Looks like it's working.

DORUN
Yes, but I don't have any idea where we're going. This section differs from my blueprints.

TARSIS
We don't have much time.

DORUN
I know.

Dorun pulls out his communicator.

DORUN
Ellis, what's your status?

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Ellis is behind cover, shooting at soldiers in a large room marked "DETENTION CENTER CONTROL ROOM". Rebels are spread out behind cover, also trying to blast their way through. Dead troopers are seen behind the rebels, they have obviously cut a bloody path through to the Control Room.

ELLIS
We've hit resistance getting to the control room. We're almost in but they're not making it easy.

CUT TO:

INT. GOVERNORS FORTRESS HALLWAY 2 - CONTINUOUS

DORUN
Well hurry up, you have trouble coming your way.

Dorun and Tarsis snaps to attention as Governor Kassus and his troops run past.

TARSIS
There's no way they can survive that.

DORUN
All the more reason we need to figure out where that Inhibitor is.

Rounding the corner Otib runs with his squad. Tarsis and Dorun snap back to attention. Otib doesn't notice them as he travels down the corridor and round the next corner.

TARSIS
I'd put credits on where he's going.

DORUN
Come on, let's follow.

The two jog after Otib.

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON CONTROL CENTER - EVENING

We see a trooper go down, Ellis overtop him. Rebels stream in from the entrance door behind Ellis.

ELLIS
Open the cell doors, and arm the prisoners. We don't have much time.

EKELLE
Here.

Ekelle taps at console.

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON CELLS - CONTINUOUS

Cell doors open, and cheering prisoners rush out. Kurdeer and rebels pass out extra weapons among them. Ellis and Ekelle meet Kurdeer and the larger group of rebels/prisoners.

ELLIS
We need to go.

Laser fire flies past Ellis, nearly hitting him. He jumps to cover. Troopers storm in from the entrance, blasters firing. The rebel group fires back.

ELLIS
We can't stay. Fall back, fall back!

Rebels start falling back to the far door. As they file out the door Ellis lays down fire from his position. Kurdeer is near him, also firing from cover.

KURDEER
Go. Go now!

Ellis looks back at the rebels, most of them have gotten through the door. Ellis nods, then runs to join them. He reaches the door and looks back at Kurdeer.

ELLIS
Kurdeer, let's go!

Kurdeer looks back, then runs towards the door. Laser fire hits him several feet from the exit. Ellis curses and Ekelle screams.

ELLIS
Kurdeer!

EKELLE ^
NOOOO!

Ellis rushes forward shooting at the troopers, who are now swarming the detention center. Ellis grabs the wounded Kurdeer and pulls him back to the door. Ekelle lays down supressing fire as the two return to the door. They get through as the Detention Center is totally overrun.

CUT TO:

INT. GOVERNORS FOTRESS HALLWAY 3 - CONTINUOUS

Ellis and Ekelle support Kurdeer as they continue their retreat.

KURDEER
Stop... Stop... I can't-

The group sets Kurdeer down. Ellis looks at the wound.

ELLIS
This looks bad.

KURDEER
It feels bad. I am not going to make it, I think.

EKELLE
No. Don't you dare say that.

KURDEER
You must go. Leave me here.

ELLIS
They're right behind us.

EKELLE
I don't care. You're all I have left. They've taken so much from me, I won't let them take you too.

KURDEER
I love you.

Ekelle is reduced to tears.

EKELLE
I love you.

Troopers are heard coming around the corner. Kurdeer pushes Ekelle towards Ellis.

KURDEER
Go. I will hold them off.

Ekelle resists, but Ellis pulls her away. He gives a nod of appreciation to Kurdeer, who smiles. Ellis throws an explosive to Kurdeer.

ELLIS
Last explosive. Take as many of them as you can.

Kurdeer nods as Ellis pulls a devestated Ekelle away. Kurdeer lays his head back as he primes the explosive device. Humming softly, troopers reach the hallways.

CUT TO:

INT. EXIT HANGER ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Ellis drags Ekelle around the corner. Ekelle breaks from Ellis's grip.

EKELLE
No. NO! I won't leave him.

Ekelle turns to go back, but a blast is heard from the hallway they just exited. Ekelle stops. Her head drops, then shoulders, until she crumples to the ground, sobbing. Ellis, at first moving to restrain her, consoles her instead.

ELLIS
I'm so sorry.

EKELLE
(to herself)
What am I going to do? What am I going to do?

ELLIS
Ekelle, listen to me.

Ekelle looks up at Ellis.

ELLIS
I know this pain is raw, I know it all to well. There will be time to mourn him, but right now we need to move.

Ekelle shakes her head, unable to move. Ellis grows slightly frustrated.

ELLIS
Kurdeer just sacrificed everything to give you a chance. Don't disrepect him.

Ekelle shoots Ellis with a dangerous look.

ELLIS
Lean into that anger. Honor him by killing them.

Ekelle closes her eyes and nods her head, pulling herself together.

EKELLE
Let's go.

Ellis pulls Ekelle up and they retreat after the rebels.

CUT TO:

INT. INHIBITOR ROOM ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Otib runs through the Inhibitor Room entrance. Behind, Dorun and Tarsis follow carefully. Dorun pulls Tarsis to a stop.

DORUN
There it is.

TARSIS
What's the plan? There's a lot more of them than there are of us, and you're a terrible shot.

DORUN
I'm not that bad.

TARSIS
Dorun, you haven't hit a single target today.

DORUN
Well... I'm more of the idea guy.

TARSIS
So then what's your big idea for getting near that thing?

Dorun pauses, thinking. He lightens when he gets an idea.

DORUN
We tell them to leave.

Tarsis drops his head, tired of hearing the same terrible idea over and over again.

DORUN
What? No, this will work. You have the explosives, right?

Tarsis shows the satchel he has with him.

DORUN
Good. I go in and I tell them that rebels are approaching. The explosive blows, they believe me, they run out to kill the rebels, we get to the Inhibitor.

TARSIS
That's not a very good plan.

DORUN
Do you have anything better.

Tarsis does not.

DORUN
Then let's get to it already. Set the charge, then hang back as I approach.

Tarsis sets a charge. He looks at Dorun, nodding his head. Dorun steadies himself to attempt the ruse.

CUT TO:

INT. INHIBITOR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dorun steps through the entrance and turns into the room. As he approaches we see Otib and his squad milling about. The few squad troopers that notice Dorun don't seem to give him any mind as he walks steadily, if nervously. Steela is hard to make out with her back turned away, talking to an Aide.

We see Tarsis moving to a column behind Dorun. Switching back to Dorun's perspective we see Steela dismiss the Aide and turn towards Dorun. Dorun, getting his first good look at her, stops dead in his tracks. His face is set in a stunned expression, a mixture of shame and regret.

DORUN
Steela.

We see a close-up of Steela as she lays eyes on the approaching Dorun. She squints, trying to place him. Eyes widen, recognition. Recognition to love. Love to confusion. Confusion to betrayal. Betrayal to hatred.

Without saying a word, she pulls the gun out of Otib's hands. Amid Otib's confusion, she points the weapon at Dorun. We see Tarsis rush towards Dorun. Steela shoots as Tarsis collides into the still stunned Dorun.

Tarsis cries out in pain as the laser fire hits him, barely getting Dorun out of the way. The milling troopers don't waste any time readying their weapons and firing at the two.

Tarsis pulls out the CAMO ENERGY SHIELD and tosses it in front of them. It expands into a rectangle a few feet squared, the area see-through but with a slight color tinge. In the center of the rectangle a circular status bar appears along with an easy-to-read "100%". As the laser fire hits the shield, it ripples like a pebble in a pond. Each hit of a laser reduces the the circular status bar and the number slightly.

From Steela's perspective we see the device expand. On her side, the two disappear completely as the rectangle expands.

TROOPER
Where'd they go?

Otib activates his helmet. Once his face is covered, he presses another button near the helmet viewport. The viewport changes from a dull, uninteresting color to a red glow. From his perspective we see a world colored by heat-signatures. Dorun and Tarsis go from invisible in regular color to clearly visible heat-signatures.

OTIB
Activate Heat-Seeking Sensors!

The troopers comply, and as their helmets activate with the same reddish glow, they resume firing at the two.

The shield is degenerating quickly, in the mid-thirties percentile.

TARSIS
I don't think we're going to make it.

DORUN
Honestly, I didn't think we'd make it this far.

Tarsis smiles, then looks through the sheild again. He pulls out the UNKNOWN GRENADE.

TARSIS
Well, if I'm gonna die, I may as well figure out what this thing does.

Tarsis activates the grenade, then tosses it at the group of enemies. They get behind cover, but nothing happens. Seeing this, they continue firing.

TARSIS
What? I'm going to kill the guy I stole that from!

Suddenly, the grenade 'pops'. Bright purple arcing lighting surrounds an expanding deep purple sphere. Loose objects shoot into the sphere. We see as the sphere fully expands, troopers have trouble standing their ground. The troopers start getting pulled into the sphere. They don't actually enter the sphere, but hover around it in a jumble. Steela and Otib are also caught.

Tarsis and Dorun are far enough away to not be affected. Seeing the display, Tarsis jumps up despite his wound. Awed by the interesting way to inflict pain, he gloats.

TARSIS
YEAHHH! HOW YOU LIKE THAT? GET SOOOOME!

The sphere subsides quite quickly, and the enemies drop to the ground. It takes a moment to register that they have not been injured. Dorun realizes it, and starts pulling Tarsis towards the entrance they arrived through. Tarsis resists, not quite understanding the point of a grenade that doesn't kill things.

TARSIS
They're not dead.

The enemy troopers have shaken off the experience and start picking up their guns, realizing themselves they haven't been killed. Dorun picks up the pace pulling Tarsis away.

DORUN
No, no they are not.

The two round the corner and leave the Inhibitor Room. Steela speaks to the troopers.

STEELA
Get them. I want them alive!

The Troopers, still slightly shaken, rush out hesitantly at first, then with more confidence.

CUT TO:

INT. INHIBITOR ROOM ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Dorun is supporting an injured Tarsis. Tarsis is starting to slump against Dorun.

DORUN
You placed that charge?

TARSIS
Uh-huh.

DORUN
Have we passed it?

TARSIS
Uh-huh.

DORUN
Can you trigger it?

TARSIS
Uh-huh.

Tarsis pull up a detonator and clicks it without any hesitation. Dorun is taken by surprise as the explosion at the door makes him stumble.

CUT TO:

INT. INHIBITOR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Troopers fly back as the explosion hits them. Seeing this, Steela whirls to Harper.

STEELA
Lock down the Fortress. Highest level.

HARPER
Ma'am, our troops won't be able to get to the other rebels at highest level.

STEELA
Do it!

Harper speaks into a communicator. Steela addresses the Troopers.

STEELA
Go around, they're not going anywhere. I want him alive!

CUT TO:

INT. INHIBITOR ROOM ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Dorun rights himself from the blast, Tarsis still leaning on him, and continues on. The Inhibitor Room Entrance is covered in debris. Dorun leads them down the hall, and as they reach the open door, it suddenly closes. The console to the side turns red: "AUTHORIZED ACCESS ONLY"

CUT TO:

INT. EXIT HANGER - SAME TIME

Ellis and the rebels are fighting off the approaching troops. They don't have anywhere else to retreat to, and every trooper they kill two more appear from the entrance.

Suddenly the entrance door slams shut, console going red. The troopers that just passed through turn and slam on the door, unsure why it's closed. They die as laser fire cuts them down. The other troopers look concerned as they continue fighting.

INT. EXIT HANGER ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

From the other side of the entrance door, we see confused looking troopers looking at the door. Governor Kassus approaches the door, angrly pushing and pulling troopers out of the way.

Kassus types in a key code on the door. "ACCESS DENIED". Kassus hits the console, now enraged. He turns to the troopers.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
Open this door. I don't care how. Rip the walls out if you have to!

TROOPER
Yes sir!

Kassus stalks off.

INT. INHIBITOR ROOM ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Dorun tries to enter a code for the door. Nothing is working. Tarsis is leaning against the wall, nursing his wound. Dorun tries a locked down door beside the one he just tried. Also fails. Dorun throws up his hands in frustration.

DORUN
Well, that's it. We're finished.

Suddenly, the door he tried last clicks green. Dorun spins, looking at the console.

DORUN
This isn't the first time today this has happened.

TARSIS
It's going the wrong way.

DORUN
We don't have much choice.

Dorun supports Tarsis as the door opens and they pass through.

CUT TO:

INT. FORTRESS HALLWAY 4 - CONTINUOUS

Dorun and Tarsis walk down another hallway. All doors are locked as they go by. As they pass by another door, it clicks green.

TARSIS
It's gotta be a trap.

DORUN
They already had us trapped.

Tarsis looks doubtful as they turn towards the door. It opens into a waiting elevator. The two get in, the door closes, and before any button can be pressed, it's moving.

TARSIS
What the hell is going on?

DORUN
I don't know.

The elevator stops, and the door opens. A small hallway with a single door at the end.

TARSIS
I have a bad feeling about this.

The two approach the door cautiously. The console doesn't click green.

DORUN
Well don't stop now.

After another pause, the console clicks green and the door opens. We see a small room, filled with consoles. Only two people are inside, a trooper and TENNA. She is a young, short, slightly squat woman. White with tattoos, with blue hair. Despite the alternative look, she holds herself slightly awkwardly.

The trooper turns to the two, frowns. He realizes they're enemies and pulls out his gun. Dorun is faster as he shoots the trooper down. He trains his weapon on TENNA.

TENNA pulls away raising her keyboard in front of her for protection. Dorun pauses.

DORUN
Is that, is that a *keyboard*?

TENNA hugs the keyboard defensively.

TENNA
I'm old school.

DORUN
How old are you?

TENNA
Younger than you, old man.

Dorun is shocked, it's the first time someone has called him an old man. He's not exactly sure how to react.

TARSIS
I like her.

Tarsis groans and slumps lower.

TENNA
Is he gonna die?

TARSIS
I've survived worse. I think.

DORUN
Who are you?

TENNA
Names Tenna, and I just happen to be the best damn hacker this side of the galaxy.

DORUN
I've never heard of you, "best damn hacker this side of the galaxy".

TENNA
The best hackers are the ones you don't hear about.

DORUN
Then what are you doing working here for *them*?

TENNA
Ah. Right. I crossed that blonde officer you've been pissing off.

DORUN
Ah.

TARSIS
Who the hell is she, anyways?

DORUN
My wife.

Tarsis bridles, Tenna whistles.

TENNA
You're telling me you're married to *Imperial Adjunct Steela Telomar*.

DORUN
She's an Adjunct now. Of course she is.

TENNA
Well unless you want to stick around for a family reunion, I brought you here for a reason.

DORUN
Oh, and what's that?

TENNA
To deal with him, mostly.

Tenna points to the downed trooper.

TENNA
They don't leave me alone for a minute. Scared of what I might do with the access I have.

TARSIS
If you're as good as you say you are, I would have killed you.

DORUN
Steela has a penchant for using dangerous tools.

TENNA
I'm no tool, but I am dangerous.

DORUN
Dangerous enough to shut down the Inhibitor?

Tenna smiles

TENNA
With the elevated privileges they've given me, I going to bring this Fortress to its knees.

CUT TO:

INT. INHIBITOR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Otib and Harper flank Steela at her desk. Steela leans against the table with both hands, head down.

STEELA
What do you mean you lost them?

OTIB
We got into the hallway from the other side. They weren't their.

Steela shoots a murderous look at Harper.

HARPER
I've triple checked, the lockdown is at the highest level. Only people you've authorized should be able to unlock doors.

Steela and Otib look at eachother.

STEELA
Tenna.

OTIB ^
Tenna.

OTIB
I told you she couldn't be trusted.

STEELA
Who says I ever trusted her. Go to the control room-

As she speaks alarms start sounding.

Steela looks at the Inhibitor. The Engineers that continue to work on it are now scrambling, running to and fro, upset. Steela stops an Engineer running past her.

STEELA
What's happening?

ENGINEER
We don't know, the Inhibitor's power consumption is rising.

Steela looks at the Inhibitor. The steady "WUMP" of the Inhibitor is increasing pace. The Engineer is horrified.

ENGINEER
It's going to overload!

The Engineer runs. We see other engineers running out of the room as well.

OTIB
Sir, we're leaving.

Otib grabs Steela by the arm. She looks at him, then nods.

OTIB
Move out, double time!

Steela, her aides and Harper, along with Otib and his squad run down a different entrance than the one usually used. A troop transport is the only thing in the room, doors already open.

Otib goes to a console and taps at it as the rest of the group files into the transport. Steela stops by Otib.

STEELA
Always have a quick escape planned, don't you?

OTIB
It's been useful more than once.

Otib finishes tapping at the console, and the ceiling opens above the transport to allow it to exit. Otib gestures Steela to enter the transport. With everyone in, the transport doors close and it takes off.

In the Inhibitor Room proper, the WUMP sound has reached dangerous levels. It suddenly seizes.

As the transport flies off, we see a giant explosion that destroys the entire west wall of the Fortress.

CUT TO:

INT. EXIT HANGER - SAME TIME

Ellis and the rebels see sparks flying from the door the Imperial Troopers are behind. They sit behind cover aprehensively. Suddenly, the room shakes and goes dark.

EKELLE
What was that?

ELLIS
I hope it was the Inhibitor.

CUT TO:

INT. WINDSWIFT COCKPIT - SAME TIME

Arianne taps at the pilots console of the ship. Suddenly, the console lights up and Arianne squees with excitement. She starts ignition and a "DEE-DEE-DEEP" sound is made.

ARIANNE
DEE-DEE-DEEP, music.

Arianne picks up the communicator.

CUT TO:

INT. FORTRESS HALLWAY 6 - SAME TIME

The hallway shakes as Dorun, Tarsis and Tenna make their way down the hallway. The lights go out and the hallways is pitch black. Tenna and Dorun activate flashlights.

DORUN
It's a good thing you cleared a path for us before overloading the Inhibitor.

TENNA
Unlike you people I plan my escape in advance.

DORUN
We've had to improvise.

TENNA
I was watching the entire time. Your plan *was* to improvise.

Before Dorun can respond his communicator squaks.

ARIANNE
(from communicator)
Dorun, we're in business, I'm in the air and heading your way.

DORUN
Perfect. Lock on to Ellis's signal, we'll meet you there.

ARIANNE
On it.

DORUN
Ellis, Arianne's on her way. We'll meet you at the hanger.

CUT TO:

INT. EXIT HANGER - CONTINUOUS

Sparks fly from the entrance the troops are behind. All troopers that were inside the hanger are dead.

ELLIS
Well you better hurry, we don't have anywhere else to run. Our ship won't hold all the rebels we've set free.

[Intercut to Dorun]:

DORUN
Arianne, you hear that?

CUT TO:

EXT. WINDSWIFT; MIDFLIGHT - CONTINUOUS

We see the Windswift mid-air. It's revealed several other ships are flying with the Windswift.

ARIANNE
Way ahead of you. Looks like the Resistance was ready for us.

[Intercut to Dorun]:

DORUN
This might actually work. Come on!

The three pick up the pace as they make their way through the dead Fortress.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. EXIT HANGER - EVENING

The sparks coming from the door stop as the door falls away, now a hole. Troopers charge through as the rebels start firing.

Dorun, Tarsis and Tenna are seen running in from an opposite angle. Ellis sees them.

ELLIS
(into communicator)
Arianne we need to go now!

CUT TO:

EXT. EXIT HANGER - CONTINUOUS

The Windswift and other ships break through the clouds, approaching the Governor's Fortress. Windswift is in the lead as it heads towards the Exit Hanger.

CUT TO:

INT. WINDSWIFT COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Arianne deftly handles the controls as the ship hurtles toward the hanger.

ARIANNE
I'm coming in now.

CUT TO:

INT. EXIT HANGER - CONTINUOUS

The troops continue filing in and have started to spread out to find cover. Ellis tries to fire, but the blaster beeps. A small holographic message appears above the blaster handle blinking "CHARGE DEPLETED".

Ellis curses, throwing down the weapon. He looks at Ekelle, who also is out of charge. The both cower under cover as laser fire passes overhead.

As the trooper begin to overrun the hanger, the Windswift pulls into the hanger bay and lands gracefully near Ellis and Ekelle. Troopers turn their fire to the ship as the doors open.

The other ships follow suit, landing near the Windswift. Rebels storm out of the ships, firing on the Troopers. The troopers head for cover, now outnumbered.

The freed prisoners start running to the transports. Tarsis, Dorun and Tenna head towards the Windswift. Ellis looks to Ekelle.

ELLIS
I guess this is goodbye.

Ekelle looks to the rebels, and back to Ellis.

EKELLE
I'm coming with you.

Ellis is obviously surprised.

EKELLE
Your crew, Dorun... This is what you do. You're trying to bring them down.

Ellis hangs his head.

EKELLE
You're trying to get revenge.

Ellis looks at her intently, revealing an undercurrent of rage. He gives a slight nod of his head.

EKELLE
Then I'm coming with you. Come on.

The two rush from behind their cover and run to the Windswift. Dorun is waiting as Ekelle enters. He gives Ellis a queer look. Ellis nods his ascent and Dorun rolls his eyes as Ellis enters. Dorun follows in and closes the hatch.

CUT TO:

INT. WINDSWIFT COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

The crew find seats or stand around the cockpit. Dorun is the last to enter.

DORUN
Everyone's in, let's get off this rock.

ARIANNE
What about those rebels?

EKELLE
Do not worry about them, Kurdeer taught them well.

DORUN
Where is he? I owe him one.

The adrenaline that had distracted Ekelle melts away. She closes up, the loss flooding back. Dorun looks confused. The look Ellis gives him tells him all he needs to know.

DORUN
Ah. I'm sorry.

Ekelle pulls her legs up and crosses her arms around them. Dorun turns back to Arianne.

DORUN
Let's go.

Arianne nods, taps at the console. The viewport from the cockpit shows the hanger shifting, light laser fire passing by.

CUT TO:

INT. EXIT HANGER - CONTINUOUS

As the rebels start pulling back to their own ships, we see the Windswift lift, hover for a moment, then raise and turn towards the exit. Light laser fire follows. The Windswift pulls out of the hanger and away from the Governor's Fortress.

CUT TO:

INT. WINDSWIFT COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

ARIANNE
Ships have been fleeing the planet in droves once the Inhibitor came down. Many have been hit by Imperial Cruisers.

DORUN
I knew it.

ARIANNE
As soon as they break orbit they get fired on. Looks like they're trying to only disable ships from leaving the system, but many have been outright destroyed.

TARSIS
This ship can't outrun an Imperial Cruiser.

ARIANNE
It can with me flying it.

CUT TO:

EXT. GULON II LOW ORBIT - CONTINUOUS

The Windswift has broken orbit and is flying through space. We see a larger ship, an Imperial Cruiser, follow in short order.

CUT TO:

INT. WINDSWIFT COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

ARIANNE
They're on us!

The ship shakes from laser fire.

DORUN
Watch the ship!

ARIANNE
Watch this!

CUT TO:

EXT. GULON II LOW ORBIT - CONTINUOUS

From the Cruisers perspective we pursue the Windswift. Lasers fire just as the ship does a wide arcing barrel roll, barely missing the laser fire.

CUT TO:

INT. WINDSWIFT COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

ARIANNE
We need to jump, now!

Dorun and Ellis move to the Nav console. The panel is still open, wires and hardware exposed. Dorun and Ellis jostle at the panel.

ELLIS
The Nav is a mess!

DORUN
(To Arianne)
I told you not to break my ship.

Arianne doesn't register, focusing on flying the ship. Ekelle sits nearby, still dazed as Kurdeer's death sets in. Tenna looks at Dorun and Ellis aprehensively, clutching her keyboard. Tarsis is doubled-over in pain.

ELLIS
(To Dorun)
You can't do that or you'll overload-

The console sparks and Ellis/Dorun sheild themselves. The console looks dead.

DORUN
(To Ellis)
What did you do?

ELLIS
What did *I* do?

ARIANNE
What's going on? We need to get out of here!

Tenna, without saying anything sets her keyboard down and pulls up a holographic monitor projected from the keyboard. She quietly starts typing away.

Tarsis stumbles towards the Nav console, intent on helping as Dorun pushes pass Ellis. They start pulling at the hardware underneath the Nav console. Neither  knows what they're doing. Ellis watches, throwing his hands up in frustration.

The cockpit shakes as more laser fire hits the Windswift.

ARIANNE
I don't know how much longer I can hold them.

CUT TO:

INT. IMPERIAL CRUISER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

A Cruiser Capitain in a sharp uniform watches the Windswift on the viewport. Bridge crew work at their stations. The clean efficiency of the Imperial ship is in stark constrast to the chaos on the Windswift Cockpit.

In the viewport, we see the Windswift dodge another volley of laser fire. The Capitain frowns.

CRUISER CAPITAIN
A decent pilot on that ship. Shame. Fire a missile, end this game.

BRIDGE CREW
Yes sir, missile locked... and away.

The MISSILE appears as a bright white light that fires from the Cruiser and heads directly towards the Windswift.

CUT TO:

INT. WINDSWIFT COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

A notification blinks in front of Arianne.

ARIANNE
Missile locked. Hold on.

The three men at the Nav console look up. They've turned the console into an absolute disaster. Tenna continues to type determinedly at her keyboard.

Intercut to Windswift Exterior: As tge MISSILE speeds closer, the Windswift pulls up. Both the MISSILE and the Cruiser follow.

DORUN
Do we have any countermeasures?

ARIANNE
It's not that kind of ship.

Arianne gets an idea.

ARIANNE
The cargo.

TARSIS
What? No! Do you know how much that cargo is worth?

DORUN
Do it!

Arianne taps at the console.

CUT TO:

INT. CRUISER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

From the bridge viewport, we see the Windswift continue to pull up, the MISSILE gaining ground. The cruiser is also pulling up, keeping the Windswift in it's viewport.

As the MISSILE reaches the Windswift, the rear cargo doors of the ship open and small cubed boxes file out. The MISSILE hits the boxes and explodes in a bright flash that fills the entirety of the viewport.

CUT TO:

INT. WINDSWIFT COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

The crew are propelled by harsh G forces, pinned to their seats as the explosion rocks the ship.

Arianne is the first to recover, laying into the controls to get the ship back on course.

CUT TO:

INT. CRUISER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

The Capitain scowls seeing the Windswift recover.

CRUISER CAPITAIN
Lock all lasers. FIRE!

The viewport shows a syncronized volley of laser fire from the many laser cannons equipped to the ship. Just as they're about to hit the Windswift, the Windswift snaps out of existence.

CRUISER CAPITAIN
Damn!

BRIDGE CREW
Shall we pursue, sir?

The cruiser capitain considers.

CRUISER CAPITAIN
No. Our orders are clear. Log the ship type and trajectory. And find me another target.

CUT TO:

INT. WINDSWIFT COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

All is quiet. Everyone still bracing for the coming impact. Ellis opens his eyes, realizing the impact never came.

Dorun slowly gets up, looking around.

DORUN
What... happened?

ELLIS
We should be dead.

ARIANNE
We managed to jump.

DORUN
How? We don't think we fixed the Nav console.

The console is smoking, wires and hardware from its compartment ripped apart.

TENNA
The Navigation systems are fine.

All eyes snap to Tenna.

TENNA
I mean, that console is destroyed, but the Nav itself is fine. I just had to reroute controls to my keyboard.

ARIANNE
We're being hailed.

DORUN
Who from?

Arianne looks at Dorun bleakly. Dorun turns back to Tenna.

DORUN
Where did you jump us to?

TENNA
I just picked the last jump location.

Dorun drops his head. A viewport near the front of the cockpit blinks on, showing MARCELLA, sitting back in a chair. Her brunette hair is perfectly set, bright red lips set in a coy smile.

MARCELLA
Well, well, well. You have a lot of nerve coming back here, Dorun Shrike.

DORUN
(To himself)
This has been a very. Long. Day.

Fade Out.
