FADE IN

EXT. AKEEN CITY, PLANET GULON II - HIGH NOON

Camera opens to the cityscape of a vaguely Middle Eastern city. Sun-bleached brick slums dominate the majority of the frame, with impossibly high glass skyscapers in the background. As the camera pans over the city, three militaristic troop transports fly past.

CUT TO:

EXT. SMALL MARKET, AKEEN SLUMS - SAME TIME

The ships land in the clearing of an abandoned open-air market in the slums. The ship doors open and soldiers with initimidating armored bodysuits storm out, heading down one of the cramped alleys.

CUT TO:

EXT. TENAMENT BUILDING, AKEEN SLUMS - SAME TIME

The soliders come to a door, surrounding it "SWAT" style. They breach and the camera follows as they clear room by room. Empty.

CUT TO:

INT. CREW SAFEHOUSE, AKEEN SLUMS - SAME TIME

From a second story window across the street, DORUN watches the raid. Specks of grey in his hair, he looks like he belongs in a classroom. He turns away from the window.

DORUN
We have to get off this planet.

Before anyone can answer, TARSIS enters the room. Blaster in hand, nondescript armored vest, scars peppering his grizzled face. He closes the door, leaving it slight ajar to keep watch through.

TARSIS
We got out just in time. We're safe for now.

Hands clasped in front of him, ELLIS sits nearby deep in thought. Younger, well dressed, handsome if a bit naive.

ELLIS
Dorun, if they're raiding our safehouse it means-

DORUN
It means we have to get off this planet.

Pensively watching the scene below, EKELLE stands close to the window. Middle Eastern descent; pretty in a determined, makes-the-hard-choices kind of way.

EKELLE
This is a setback, yes, but you can't run now.

TARSIS
Ekelle is right. If we run now we trash months of work setting up to cripple the Empires' control on Gulon Two.

EKELLE
The Empire that took my family. The Rebellion can help-

DORUN
The Empire has taken something from all of us. And we're not part of your Rebellion.

ELLIS
Do you know how much we'll be losing if we run now? Not even counting bribes, we'll be abandoning contacts its taken months to establish.

TARSIS
I'm finally making headway with my black market connections.

DORUN
None of which matters if we're dead. Look I don't want to run any more than you lot do, but we just got very lucky. It's only a matter of time before they connect the dots. I don't plan on being here when they do.

Dorun pulls a small handheld communicator out of his pocket.

DORUN (CONT'D)
Arianne, get the ship ready. We're leaving.

CUT TO:

INT. SHIP: WINDSWIFT; COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Cables, tools and hardware are strewn about the run-down cockpit of the Crew Freighter. ARIANNE's head pops out from under the console she was in the process of fixing.

Arianne curses as she tries to find the communicator amid the mess. Picking it up she attempts to sound calm and composed.

ARIANNE
Yes, Dorun. Right away.

She looks around at the mess.

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
I'll get right on that...

DORUN
(From Communicator)
Have you been sleeping on the job?

ARIANNE
Excuse me? I haven't slept in days. I barely got the ignition coil working again and now the Nav console keeps losing power.

DORUN
You better not be breaking my ship.

ARIANNE
I'm the only reason this junker can even get off the ground.

ARIANNE flips several switches. A negative sounding "wump" responds.

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
Or not.

She tries again. Same negative Wump.

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
"Wump"? You're not supposed to "Wump". When I start primary ignition you go "Dee-Dee-Deep".

ARIANNE taps at the panel looking for the issue.

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
It can't be the Nav causing this. We have enough fuel. Ignition coil OK. Oh. Oh that's not good.

CUT TO:

INT. CREW SAFEHOUSE, AKEEN SLUMS - SAME TIME

EKELLE
You said you would help us!

DORUN
I said I *could* help you, there's a difference.

ARIANNE
(From communicator)
Dorun, we have a problem. Something is blocking engine startup.

Pause

ARIANNE
All ships on the planet are affected.

Worried look shared by DORUN/ELLIS

ELLIS
Imperial Inhibitor Tech.

DORUN
The situation is worse than I thought.

EKELLE
What's going on?

ELLIS
The Empire has overridden control of all ships on the planet.

DORUN
Only authorized Imperial ships are able to fly.

EKELLE
That means-

DORUN
It means that the Empire knows all about your revolt.

EKELLE
Thats... That's not possible.

DORUN
Our safehouse gets raided the same day all ships on the planet are grounded? The Empire is making their move.

ELLIS
What do we do?

DORUN
What I've been saying all along. We have to get off this planet.

[ROLL TITLE CREDITS]

INT. AKEEN SLUMS SAFEHOUSE

DORUN
So we have a planet about to tear itself apart, a ship that can't fly, and the most dangerous troops in the galaxy between us and freedom. What do we do?

Silence.

DORUN (CONT'D)
Well don't everyone speak at once.

TARSIS
Can we hack in and clear our ship for launch?

ELLIS
I have access codes that can get us into the Imperial Network.

DORUN
Too suspicious. They'll have cruisers patrolling, we'll be shot down before we get into orbit.

EKELLE
I have to warn the others.

TARSIS
I say we go in blasters blazing.

ELLIS
Tarsis, we won't get far if we just start shooting. We still have those Imperial uniforms from the Ikketar job. We could get into the Restricted Zone without firing a shot.

TARSIS
Ellis, The last time we used those uniforms I nearly got blasted at the first checkpoint!

ELLIS
Well if you hadn't called him a drunken Telosin maybe it wouldn't have blown our cover!

EKELLE
We can still save the rebellion but we have to act now!

DORUN
OI!

Everyone's attention snaps to Dorun

DORUN (CONT'D)
I've made my decision. And we're doing it your way.

ELLIS
Uh. Who's way?

DORUN
All of yours.

TARSIS
Huh?

DORUN
We won't get far if we try and shoot our way in, but those uniforms will only get us so far. Tarsis, that means you get to shoot something today.

Tarsis looks pleased.

EKELLE
But the rebel-

DORUN
(interuppting)
-The rebellion can help us help them. I assume whatever plan you had for this uprising includes having flyable ships?

Ekelle reluctantly nods.

DORUN
Then taking down that Inhibitor helps us both.

TARSIS
So... what are we gonna do?

DORUN
Ekelle, contact the rebellion. Tell them that if they want to be useful to meet us North of the Bazaar in one hour. We're going back to the ship to get ready.

ELLIS
Ready for what, exactly?

DORUN
The Empire's made their move, it's time we made ours.

TARSIS
There's an intergalactic army between us and that Inhibitor.

EKELLE
The rebellion doesn't trust you.

ELLIS
We have no time to prepare for this plan.

The camera closes on Dorun, totally confident.

DORUN
Perfect.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SHIP: WINDSWIFT; MAIN ROOM
The main room is cramped, lived-in, with a small cluttered table on one side and a cylindrical console on the other. Open to see Dorun dressed in an officers uniform. He looks slightly uncomfortable. Ellis beside him is dressed in Imperial soldiers armor. They size each other up.

ELLIS
You look terrible.

DORUN
These uniforms never did fit me.

Enter Tarsis, also in soldier uniform. He is heavily armed, comically so.

ELLIS
You must be joking.

TARSIS
What?

DORUN
One gun, Tarsis. You'll raise suspicion.

ELLIS
He'll raise hell.

Tarsis sniffs, but accepts. He pulls out a number of odd devices, laying the equipment out on the table.

TARSIS
(Petuently)
Fine, but I am bringing these. Camo energy shield, sensor disruption mine, and *this*.

Tarsis pulls out an UNKNOWN GRENADE

ELLIS
What is it?

TARSIS
(with a childs wonder)
I have no idea. I got it off a arms dealer back on Ungvar Four.

ELLIS
And he didn't tell you what it was?

TARSIS
He... didn't get the chance.

ELLIS
You stole it.

Tarsis sputters thinking of a lie

DORUN
He stole it.

ELLIS ^
He stole it.

Enter Ekelle with KURDEER, a Middle Eastern man who looks like he's endured a hard life.

DORUN
How did you get on my ship? How did you even know where my ship was?

EKELLE
Perhaps you should give the Resistance more credit.

DORUN
(To Kurdeer)
We'll see about that. I don't like strangers on my ship.

KURDEER
I am Kurdeer.

DORUN
Well Kurdeer you can call me Dor-

KURDEER
You are Dorun Pepsis Ryzer, owner of the cargo freighter *Windswift* and the legitimate trading business you run from it. Of course, that's a front for the blackmarket and mercenary outfit you run.

DORUN
You know my middle name. Ellis didn't even know my middle name. Perhaps I *should* give your little rebellion more credit.

KURDEER
We know much, Captain Ryzer-

DORUN
I'm no captain. Call me Dorun.

KURDEER
As you wish, Dorun. Although now that I see this ship, I do not think Windswift is an appropriate name.

DORUN
She's faster than she looks.

KURDEER
I doubt that. Regardless, Ekelle has convinced me to meet with you.

TARSIS
Too late, the Empires already sprung their trap.

DORUN
I assume our safehouse wasn't the only one raided?

KURDEER
Many of our comrades have been captured. What's more concerning is our grounded ships. Ekelle says you can help us.

DORUN
We can help each other. Come.

Dorun motions for everyone to gather around the cylindrical console. After punching a few buttons a 3D hologram appears suspended from the base of the console. The hologram shows 3D blueprints of a large facility. Different sections highlight in a loop, notes pointing to different rooms/sections.

DORUN
This is the Governor's Fortress. Since the Empire took control, this facility has become the center of government administration for the entire planet. If the Inhibitor is going to be anywhere, it will be here.

EKELLE
That complex is huge. The Inhibitor could be anywhere in there.

DORUN
An inhibitor that can stop ships planet-wide is going to be large. Very large. Also, it would have to be installed quite recently, or we would have seen the signs.

ELLIS
Has there been any large construction efforts near the Fortress?

DORUN
I don't know. We could only get blueprints from the initial construction.

TARSIS
So we don't know about any changes since it was built. Great.

KURDEER
But *we* do. We have been watching the Fortress for some time. On the west side, here **[points to blueprint]**, an extension to the spaceport is underway.

EKELLE
Security is high there. Too high for simple construction.

DORUN
That has to be it. I think I might be impressed after all.

TARSIS
So how do we get in?

DORUN
(To Kurdeer)
You're not going to like this.

Kurdeer eyes Dorun suspiciously.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. IMPERIAL INHIBITOR; GOVERNORS FORTRESS; PLANET GULON II

The camera shows a beautiful, statuesque blonde with a clean, commanding uniform, hair pulled back in a severe ponytail. With an aura of absolute authority, Imperial Adjunct STEELA POLIS stands at a console, aides bustling around her. Hologram projections flank the Adjunct showing supply rates, troop positioning and other logitical information.

She taps at the holograms, dismissing some, highlighting others. An Aide, HARPER, approaches with a holographic tablet in hand, saluting Steela.

STEELA
Status Report.

HARPER
Troop positioning planet-wide is underway, as per your orders. The Inhibitor is running sufficiently, but Engineering continues to report facily-wide system failures due to the power required to operate it.

STEELA
Tell them to work with what they have. It is imperitive the Inhibitor stays active.

HARPER
Yes, sir. Also, raids against rebel safehouses are complete, but were less successful than projected.

STEELA
Explain.

HARPER
Many were empty by the time we got there.

Steela waits a beat, considering.

STEELA
Bad intel?

HARPER
We're interrogating our informants now, but it appears the targets were warned by an *outside* source.

Steela frowns.

STEELA
(to herself)
There's an unknown variable here. (To Harper) Get me the raid debriefings. Something is off, and we can't afford any surprises.

HARPER
Yes sir, right away sir.

Harper retreats. As she leaves through the door, GOVERNOR KASSUS enters. A belligerent man with a receding hairline and a glib demeanor.

AIDE
Atten-HUT!

Everyone snaps to attention, not Steela. She closes her eyes, gathering strength to deal with another distraction.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
Everyone out!

STEELA
Halt! Everyone stays.

Everyone in the room shifts uncomfortably, unsure of the protocol. No one leaves, and Kassus snarls- not used to be outranked. He stalks towards Steela.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
Do you have any idea the danger you've put us in? Your orders have put my entire defense force in disarray. Hell the Fortress is nearly undefended, rebels could walk right in!

Steela wait a long beat before answering. Aides and attendents in the room strain to appear uninterested.

STEELA
Kassus, you are simple, weak, coward.

Kassus face flushes, rage building. Seeing this, Steela's head of security, OTIB, steps forward. He gives Kassus a threatening look. As the Governor regains control of his emotions, Steela dismisses Otib with a lazy hand gesture.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
(tightly controlled)
I had hoped, Steela, we could have a civil discussion-

STEELA
You refer to me as Adjunct, Kassus. Imperial Adjunct. The only one on this backwards planet that outranks you.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
I am not disputing that, but I have several concerns-

STEELA
I am not disputing that *sir*. You don't seem to be getting the point, Governor.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
Apologies... sir.

STEELA
Let me be clear, I have full authority on this planet. Troops, supplies, even you. I could order you to the front line if I wanted to.

Kassus blanches at the prospect.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
You wouldn't dare!

STEELA
Try me.

Kassus waits before answering, his anger subsiding as he swallows his pride.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
With respect... Sir... It is my duty to raise concerns about your coming offensive. My... Our troops are stretched too thin. This Fortress is barely defended.

Steela lightens slightly hearing his tone.

STEELA
Your concerns have been noted, Governor. The troops guarding this facility have been moved to reinforce key positions. This Inhibitor protects the Fortress now. Without ships no enemy can approach in force.

A wall to the Adjuncts side is revealed to be part of a very large, complex machine. The Planetary Ship Inhibitor. Engineers huddle near open compartments of the machine at various locations.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
And if the rebels do find a way to attack the fortress?

STEELA
I don't want to be on this planet any longer than I have to be, Governor. Attacking this Fortress would be a suicide mission.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
But-

STEELA
That is quite enough, Governor. You are dismissed.

Kassus nearly chokes at the abrupt dismissal.

GOVERNOR KASSUS
Yes, sir.

Kassus leaves, walking quickly while snapping at his attendents. Steela is briefly pleased before returning to her reports.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CREW FREIGHTER: MAIN ROOM

Establishing shot of the Windswift in a crowded public shipyard. Cut to inside the main room of the ship.

KURDEER
(hostile)
You want us to do what!?

EKELLE
This is a suicide mission!

DORUN
It's the only way.

EKELLE
It's lunacy.

DORUN
It will work!

KURDEER
Let me get this straight. You want to us to march up to the Restricted Zone checkpoint and *get arrested*?

DORUN
Well, I'll be the one arresting you, but yeah that's the jist.

KURDEER
Who do you think you are?

DORUN
The only one on this planet that can get your ships off the ground.

A long beat. Kurdeer and Ekelle share a look.

EKELLE
We'll do it.

KURDEER
What? Ekelle! He can't be trusted!

Kurdeer pulls Ekelle aside. A hushed, heated conversation ensues, words indistinguable. Body language shows Ekelle getting the upper hand. It's obvious they're "together".

Kurdeer aquiesces, turns back to group.

KURDEER
(begrudgingly)
Fine. We will be at the Bazaar as you ask. If this is some trick-

DORUN
It's not a trick. (To Ekelle) Thank you.

EKELLE
Tell me, truthfully. Will this work?

DORUN
It has to.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CHECKPOINT BAZAAR - AKEEN SLUMS; GULON II

Open to show Dorun, Ellis, and Tarsis walking through an abandoned bazaar. Stalls are fully stocked, animals feast on unguarded foodstuffs, it looks like the area was abandoned in a hurry. The trio are on edge as they make their way through the bazaar.

TARSIS
Where is everyone?

ELLIS
People smell trouble. Only fools would be out here when the Empire cracks down.

TARSIS
Including us?

ELLIS
Especially us.

As they pass through the bazaar they nearly miss Ekelle and Kurdeer standing inconspicuously near one of the stalls.

EKELLE
Psst.

The trio spin nervously, raising their weapons.

KURDEER
I would ask you to not shoot us.

TARSIS
You scare me like that again I'll shoot you out of principle.

DORUN
Ekelle, Kurdeer. I do hope there will be more joining us?

EKELLE
You do not see them?

Ekelle motions with her hand. Several poorly dressed rebels appear from nowhere, evidently blended in with the area.

DORUN
Very good. Alright, my alias should get us through the checkpoint. With any luck we'll walk right through.

ELLIS
And if we don't have any luck?

Dorun gives Ellis a look.

DORUN
We improvise. Tarsis, show them how it's done.

Tarsis takes on the demeanor of a drill sargeant.

TARSIS
MOVE IT YOU SLOVENLY LOT. I HAVEN'T SEEN A SADDER DISPLAY OF SLUMRATS IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. MOVE IT!

The rebel group is surprised, some taking offence.

TARSIS
(conspiratorially)
This won't work if it looks like you're going to jump me, put your heads down and play the part... AND IF I SEE SO MUCH AS A FINGER OUT OF PLACE I'LL PERSONALLY RIP YOUR THROAT OUT.

ELLIS
(privately to Dorun)
He enjoys this a bit too much...

The group, led by the Imperial-disguised crew march towards the checkpoint.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. RESTRICTED ZONE CHECKPOINT - LATE AFTERNOON

The group arrive near the end of the bazaar. Abruptly the bazaar ends and the scene opens up to a fortified military complex.

The "checkpoint" turns out to be very large gates surrounded by heavily armed soldiers. Watchtowers, gun nests, barbed wire, a small army defends the area. The gates are closed, guards dot the various watchtowers surrounding the area. A main guardhouse sit behind fortified heavy weaponry.

The disguised trio march the rebel group through to the checkpoint proper, a small outpost in front of the massive metal gates. Soldiers watch the group pass with a range of looks ranging from boredom to confusion to apathy.

Tarsis stops the group in front of the outpost.

TARSIS
HALT!

An imperial trooper rushes towards the crew. He salutes Dorun.

CHECKPOINT GUARD
Sir! Apologies sir, we do not have your arrival on the order sheet, Officer _____?

DORUN
(haughty, a bit forced)
Never mind, soldier. I assume our transport is ready.

Ellis and Tarsis share a look. "Really, that's your Officer voice?"

CHECKPOINT GUARD
Uhh... sorry sir... uhh... let me check with the Duty Officer.

Dorun shares a look with Ellis/Tarsis

DORUN
Very well.

The soldier turns away and calls it in. Ellis turns to his companions.

TARSIS
A lot of troops here for a simple checkpoint.

ELLIS
It must be a staging area for whatever the Empire has planned.

DORUN
This was a mistake.

TARSIS
Too late now.

The guard turns back to the group.

CHECKPOINT GUARD
One moment, the Officer is on his way.

A rotund officer steps out of the Checkpoints main office. Red cheeks snarl as he tucks his top into his trousers and marches towards the group. He barks some orders at some nearby troopers as he makes his way to the group.

CUT TO:

EXT. RESTRICTED ZONE CHECKPOINT - CONTINUOUS

Dorun sees the Officer heading his way. He turns quietly to Ellis.

DORUN
(quietly)
We have a problem. He outranks me.

Ellis doesn't have time to react as the officer reaches the group.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
What the hell is this?

Dorun snaps to attention.

DORUN
Sir. Junior Dominant Reese Karsor reporting.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Junior Dominant Reese Karsor what the hell are you doing at my checkpoint? And why the hell do you have these stinking slumrats with you?

Dorun looks at the rebels, seeing flashes of anger from the group he puts his hand on the officer's arm.

DORUN
(quietly, respectfully)
Perhaps sir, it would be best if we chatted in private.

The officer casts a look of disgust across the rebels

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Come.

The Officer leads Dorun his private office in the main guardhouse.

CUT TO:

INT. CHECKPOINT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The office is tastifully furnished. The warm, inviting room is decorated with cultural artifacts and emits a warm glow- stark contrast to the efficient functionality of the rest of the checkpoint. Hand-sized native statues stand on a cabinet on one of the walls. As the officer leans on his main desk, Dorun goes to the statues.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Well?

DORUN
These are original Gulonese ritual statues, aren't they?

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Cut the crap, Junior Dominant.

Dorun turns toward the Officer and leans back against the cabinet.

DORUN
Sir, my orders are to publicly arrest and transport those informants.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Informants?

DORUN
Yes sir, rebels considered assets by the Intelligence Division.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
If they're "assets" why arrest them?

DORUN
My guess, sir, is to maintain their cover.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Just like Intelligence to waste my time.

DORUN
Yes sir.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
So you've come to my checkpoint with a dozen rebels on some halfbaked plan to arrest them?

DORUN
Thats... Exactly right, sir.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Wasted effort. These Gulon's are cattle. I was posted at Hyrus Seven. Now *they* were something.

DORUN
I heard about Hyrus Seven. Violent.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
These fringe planets are all the same. Get the natives under the heel of your boot. Then squeeze.

Dorun shakes off the disgust. Checkpoint Officer frowns, smelling weakness. He shifts off the desk he was leaning against and shifts towards Dorun suspiciously.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
(menacingly)
Where are you stationed out of, Junior Dominant?

DORUN
(hesitant)
Central Planets... mostly... This is my first tour on the Outer Rim.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
You soft Centralites. That's what I hate. I've been out here for years.

DORUN
Yes... Sir-

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
I'm not finished! You Centralites are all the same. Cozy posts on safe planets, only coming out here to sniff out a promotion. I'm bringing civilization to these savages. What have you done?

DORUN
I'm just following orders, sir.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Well I'm giving you an order to get out of my sight!

DORUN
Sir... I'd be happy to, as soon as you give us a troop transport.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
(exploding)
WHAT? You think I'm going to give you one of MY transports?

The officer gets closer to Dorun.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
You impetuant little man. Do you have any idea who I am?

The officer is getting closer. A closeup shot shows Dorun's hand groping for one of the statues, his eyes remaining on the Officer. The officer is breathing down Dorun's neck.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
I'll have you buried Junior Dominant, you hear me, buried!

Dorun swings the statue across the head of the Officer in one smooth motion. He's dead before he hits the ground.

DORUN
Looks like you'll be the one getting buried.

Dorun rushes to the door, listening to see if anyone outside heard. Satisfied, he goes to the console on the main desk, authorizing a transport.

Task complete, Dorun moves to the Officer, taking a keycard and a communicator. He takes a moment to compose himself before leaving the office, closing the door behind him.

CUT TO:

EXT. RESTRICTED ZONE CHECKPOINT - CONTINUOUS

DORUN
The transport is being readied now.

Dorun moves to the checkpoint guard.

DORUN
The good officer says he's not to be disturbed. He didn't seem to be in a very good mood, I suggest you listen.

The guard is well aware of his Officer's temper.

CHECKPOINT GUARD
Yes sir.

The guard leaves and returns to his post, giving the order to open the gates. As the large doors open, Dorun returns to the group.

ELLIS
(quietly)
What happened?

DORUN
(quietly)
I improvised.

CUT TO:

EXT. CHECKPOINT LANDING PAD - CONTINOUS

Behind the gates a landing port for small ships sits with a number of troop transports. One is being prepped for launch. The group approaches the ship.

DORUN
We don't have much time. You still know how to fly those things right?

Dorun motions to the transport.

ELLIS
Well I'm no ace fighter pilot like Arianne, but I can fly it.

DORUN
You'll have to. We can't afford to land in the main spaceport. We won't be able to slip away.

ELLIS
So what do we do?

DORUN
What do *you* have to do? Deal with it.

Ellis blanches, but covers it up quickly. Dorun nods for Ellis to put the ruse back up as the group approaches the ship.

CUT TO:

EXT. TROOP TRANSPORT - CONTINUOUS

Ship technicians check the ship as the group approach. They ignore the group as they disconnect hoses and tap at diagnostic panels. Tarsis pushes the rebels towards the large main door of the transport.

TARSIS
Move it!

The rebels file in and Tarsis orders the doors to be closed. He joins Dorun and Ellis as they make their way towards the cockpit entrance.

CUT TO:

INT. TROOP TRANSPORT COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

The cockpit features four seats two by two, with the entrance to the rear of the cockpit. The pilot is in the left front seat, Ellis takes the seat beside him, Dorun and Tarsis sit in the backseats.

PILOT
Destination?

DORUN
Governor's Fortress.

PILOT
Strap in.

CUT TO:

EXT. TROOP TRANSPORT - CONTINUOUS

The ship technicians scatter before the ship takes off, turning in a smooth arc away from the landing pad.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TROOP TRANSPORT - EARLY EVENING

The transport flies in the air, breaking through light clouds.

CUT TO:

INT. TROOP TRANSPORT COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

We see an indifferent pilot, a self-conscious Ellis, an impatient looking Dorun, and a snoring Tarsis.

Ellis is quite busy not looking at Dorun. Fed up, Dorun leans forward and tugs Ellis' shoulder. Ellis gestures "who me?", Dorun "Get on with it". Ellis "Ok, ok, I'll do it.". Dorun "I'm watching you." All this without a sound.

ELLIS
Ah... We... We need you to land somewhere else.

PILOT
What are you talking about?

Dorun shoots Ellis with a "Not good enough" expression. Ellis considers his options. He moves to speak again, but stops before saying anything. He grows frustrated, then realizes what he's going to do. He looks to Dorun, then the Pilot.

ELLIS
Sorry about this.

PILOT
What?

Ellis punches the Pilot hard, then brings his hand back and shakes it off, realizing the stupidity of punching a man with a helmet on in the head. The Pilot looks at Ellis confused. Seeing his gambit failing, Ellis punches the Pilot again, this time on the jaw.

The punch is enough to lurch the transport, a quick camera shot in the main compartment shows the rebels falling over with the unexpected shift in direction. Tarsis wakes abruptly.

TARSIS
(half-dreaming)
What? Aww yeah GUT HIM!

The Pilot tries to grab Ellis, who attempts to strike the pilot again. The Pilot fends off the attack, getting a decent hold on Ellis and pulling him down. From his viewpoint, Ellis sees a red "Eject" lever on the pilots chair.  Ellis breaks from the Pilots grip, strikes again, then puts both hands on the lever. The pilot looks down, realizing what Ellis is going to do. He looks back up to Ellis.

PILOT
(sad and scared)
Please no.

ELLIS
I said I was sorry.

Ellis pulls the lever. The Pilots chair explodes laterally from his side of the ship with awesome force. The other seats are unaffected, and Ellis flails to catch his grip. The room roars as air rushes in the cockpit.

Ellis manages to get back into his seat, and stuggles to get the ship back under control. The ship is roaring with a rising pitch like a WWII dive bomber. Pulling up, he finally gets the ship back on course and puts on the comm helmet.

CUT TO:

INT. FLIGHT CONTROL CENTER, GOVERNORS FORTRESS - CONTINUOUS

Flight Control isn't a hard job, mostly tedious, but the last several weeks have been particular bad with long days and few breaks. The message that a Troop Transport has just had an ejection event sparks mild interest in an otherwise exhausted Flight Controller.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Transport Three-Seven-Two this is Flight Control. We just detected an ejection event on your ship, please respond.

[Intercut between Flight Control Interior and Transport Cockpit Interior]

Ellis is startled, not exactly sure what to do.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
I say again, we've detected someone ejecting from your ship. Please respond.

ELLIS
Uh... Everything is fine here, I don't know what you're talking about.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Transport Three-Seven-Two your ship has clearly logged an ejection event. You're also showing significant yaw drag.

ELLIS
No, no ejection here. Your sensors must be off.

The Flight Controller scoffs.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Our sensors are working just fine. You-

ELLIS
Look I don't know what to tell you. I would know if someone ejected.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Your ship must be logging bad flight data.

Ellis struggles at the controls, the ejection hole has produced significant drag.

ELLIS
If you say so, she's running smooth on my end.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Transport Three-Seven-Two you're hereby ordered to Shipyard B-Nine-Alpha for immediate diagnostics and repair.

ELLIS
Oh kay.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Transport Three-Seven-Two correct your flight trajectory to Shipyard-

ELLIS
I have, your sensors must be off again.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Why I have never- Transport Three-Seven-Two I will have you written up so fast-

Ellis pulls off the helmet. As he speaks he alternates the helmet from close to far from his mouth.

ELLIS
Sorry... breaking up... Can't... hear you.

Ellis tosses the helmet out the ejection hole.

DORUN
What the hell was that?

ELLIS
Improvising.

Dorun looks towards Tarsis, who nods his head agreeably.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. IMPERIAL INHIBITOR; GOVERNORS FORTRESS - EARLY EVENING

Steela continues to sift through her hologram reports. She appears more stressed than before. Harper approaches.

HARPER
Sir, you asked to be alerted if there was any odd reports?

STEELA
Yes?

HARPER
A transport has gone AWOL.

STEELA
Oh?

HARPER
We're attempting to determine the cause, it looks like equipment malfunction.

STEELA
Where is the transport headed?

HARPER
At it's current course it will arrive here in minutes.

STEELA
Continue monitoring the transport, and find out where it came from.

HARPER
Already on it, sir.

Steela dismisses Harper with a hand wave. As Harper leaves, she puts a hand to her ear as she receives a report. She frowns, realizes the relevance of the report and looks to Steela. She approaches Steela again.

HARPER
Sir, the transport was found to come from a checkpoint near the grand bazaar. The officer who ordered the transport has been found dead. It can't be coincedence.

STEELA
Agreed.

HARPER
I'll alert the Fortress Defenses.

STEELA
Wait.

She closes her eyes, doing the math in her head.

STEELA
I won't give that sniffling Governor the satisfaction of knowing he was right. Otib, take your men and deal with it.

OTIB
Yes, sir.

Otib gathers his troops with a hand gesture and leaves in a hurry.

CUT TO:

INT. TROOP TRANSPORT - EARLY EVENING

ELLIS
There it is.

CUT TO:

EXT. GOVERNORS FORTRESS - CONTINUOUS

The ship breaks through the clouds and reveals the magnitude of the Governors Fortress. With a length and width that measure in kilometers, the Fortress is massive.

Near the west side construction is underway, and ships buzz to and fro from the Fortress as bees from a hive. The transport speeds towards its destination.

CUT TO:

INT. TROOP TRANSPORT - CONTINUOUS

DORUN
There, you can see the construction on the west side.

TARSIS
We can't fly right in, the security there will be too high.

ELLIS
He's right. Looks like there's an empty service bay outside the construction zone.

DORUN
Do it.

CUT TO:

EXT. LANDING SITE; GOVERNORS FORTRESS - CONTINUOUS

The landing site turns out to be a minor service bay for the major construction effort underway on the Fortress, while outside the construction zone proper, is littered with construction equipment, open panels and other errata.

Usually used as a shortcut for providing/retrieving equipment, the area is currently empty. Two large service doors are closed beside a small console coloured with distinct red "no entry" message.

The edge of the landing site is a sheer dropoff, a small outcropping on the massive structure.

The ship lands, a bit sloppily, and the main doors open. Dorun and the others meet with the shaken group of rebels.

EKELLE
Who the hell was flying that thing.

ELLIS
It's harder than it looks.

DORUN
Kurdeer, get your men behind cover. Tarsis, go with them. We'll have company soon enough. Ellis, let's get this door open.

The rebels spread out, taking cover near equipment and the transport. Dorun and Ellis run to the console. It's mostly red, with bright letters stating "AUTHORIZED ACCESS ONLY"

ELLIS
Can you get in?

Dorun taps at the console, entering an authorization code. "ACCESS DENIED" responds.

DORUN
My access code isn't good enough.

ELLIS
Let me try.

Ellis takes over at the console. He taps for a bit, then reaches behind the console between the panel and the wall. Something short-circuits and the console goes black.

DORUN
What did you do?

ELLIS
Just hold on.

The console sputters to life. Instead of the brightly colored graphical interface seen before, a much more primitive terminal spews text. Ellis taps at the console.

DORUN
Hurry up.

ELLIS
Hold on, hold on.

DORUN
We don't have much time!

ELLIS
Would you let me concentrate? Just have to reroute power and...

Sirens start blaring as an alarm is tripped. Dorun and Ellis take a moment looking to look at each other.

DORUN
Did you just trip the alarm?

ELLIS
I don't know, that should have worked!

DORUN
Did you just trip that alarm?

ELLIS
Well maybe if you had let me concentrate.

DORUN
I gave you one job.

ELLIS
What? You've given me like seventeen jobs, and pile more on before I can finish any.

DORUN
Really, you want to have this conversation now?

ELLIS
You don't show me any respect, you micromanage everything, and I always get the smallest room!

Tarsis approaches.

TARSIS
What the hell is going on here?

DORUN
Ellis is dissatified with my management decisions.

TARSIS
What? I don't care, we're sitting ducks out here.

Suddenly several troops, led by Otib, burst forth from around the corner. Blasters fire and several rebels go down.

TARSIS
INCOMING!

Tarsis pushes Ellis towards some construction equipment and follows, shielding Dorun like a bodyguard as he joins Ellis behind cover. Both the rebels and the crew are pinned down by the supressing fire.

Tarsis look past the cover, takes aim and fires. A trooper goes down. The rest of the troops scramble to get to cover themselves.

Otib slides towards some cover. While Imperial Troopers and Rebels exchange fire, Otib takes out a small sphere. He presses a button on it then throws it in the air above him. Mid-air, the device snaps open along its seams, revealing a small jet and a camera.

Otib expands a holographic screen from his wristband. We see the flying devices camera perspective on the screen. From it's vantage we see the rebels and crew fighting. Enemies become highlighted in red, able to be seen even behind cover.

Pleased, Otib closes the tablet. On the back of head we see a helmet base (as part of his armor), Otib presses a button on the helmet and it expands to cover his head. Once fully covered, Otib looks towards the rebels. From his perspective, we see that he sees the red highlighted enemy generated by the flying device.

OTIB
You won't be getting away from me.

Otib fires. With his extended vision he's able to hit several rebels. Other rebels stop firing back, once again pinned by the troopers fire.

Tarsis sees the rebels go down. He looks at Dorun and Ellis, also trying to stay out of the line of fire. Expression firming with resolve, he jumps out from his cover. He fires while running towards the transport.

Seeing Tarsis charge, Dorun and Ellis lean out from their cover to help lay down supressing fire, giving Tarsis a chance.

Tarsis makes it to the transport. He gets in and quickly turns the ship on. We see the transport hover, then turn towards the enemy troops.

ELLIS
What the hell is he doing?

We see Tarsis push the acceleration level all the way, then jump out of the ejection hole, rolling into a crouch. The transport speeds toward the enemy troops, who scramble to get out of the way. We see Otib realize whats coming and barely jump out of the way of the oncoming ship.

This ship takes out a few troopers, then flies past the troopers. We follow the transport as it arcs towards a far tower on the Fortress. It collides in a massive exposion.

Tarsis continues shooting, several Troopers going down due to a lack of available cover. We see Otib nearly get hit.

OTIB
Fall back! With me!

The troopers follow Otib, firing as they retreat around the corner they had originally come from.

DORUN
We need to get those doors open! They'll be back with reinforcements.

The crew and the rebels huddle by the door. Ellis taps at the console. He throws up his hands in futility. Suddenly, with no one touching the console, it lights up in a bright green color showing the words "ACCESS GRANTED". The doors open.

ELLIS
I... I didn't do that.

DORUN
No time for that now, get inside!

The group files into the Fortress proper. Tarsis keeps an eye out as everyone files in, before bringing up the rear. Tarsis takes out the SENSOR DISRUPTION MINE, activates it, and tosses it behind him.

TARSIS
This will hide our a tracks for a while.

From Otib's perspective, we see he sees the red outlined rebels are in the building from his vantage point.

OTIB
They've gotten in, follow me!

Otib charges around the corner and after the rebels. As he reaches the mine an electric shock bursts from the mine. The troops squirm in pain momentarily. We see Otib deactivate his helmet.

OTIB
Damn!
