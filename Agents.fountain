AGENTS OF THE EMPIRE

FADE IN:
EXT. AKEEN, PLANET GULON II - DAY
Camera opens to a vaguely Middle Eastern city. Brick slums dominate the city, with impossibly high skyscapers in the background. Smoke rises from sections of the slums.
Three militaristic spaceships fly past the camera, two troop carriers and gunship. Radio chatter is heard as they fly past.

EXT. AKEEN SLUMS, PLANET GULON II - CONTINUOUS
A woman in one of the slums streets looks overhead as the three ships fly by. She turns and enters a nondescript building and finds an office with several characters inside, a conversation already underway.

DORUN
We got to get off this planet.

EKELLE
Excuse me?

DORUN
Your "rebellion" is about to tear this planet apart.

EKELLE
This rebellion is trying to free this planet from the Empire. The same Empire you're trying to get away from.

DORUN
They haven't caught me yet. Joining some doomed rebellion sounds like a great way to get caught.

EKELLE
You and your crew have the ability to help us.

DORUN
Not now, I don't. If we had gotten here earlier, maybe. But not now.

EKELLE
You said you would help us.

DORUN
No, I said I could help you. There's a difference.

ELLIS
DORUN, do you know how much we'll be losing if we run now? Not even counting bribes, we'll be abandoning contacts its taken months to establish.

TARSIS
We're finally making headway with our black market connections.

DORUN
None of which matters if we're dead. Look I don't want to run any more than you lot do, but all this revolt is going to do is flush out the rebellion leaders. I've seen it before, they're playing right into the Empires hands

DORUN (CONT'D)
(Speaking into communicator)
ARIANNE, get the ship ready. We're leaving.

INT. CREW FREIGHTER
Cables and hardware are strewn about. ARIANNE's head pops out of a console she was in the process of "fixing".

ARIANNE
(Hesitant)
Um... OK Dorun.

DORUN
(From Communicator)
What have I told you about sleeping on the job?

ARIANNE
Not likely. That's your job. I was just recalibrating the Nav.

DORUN
You better not be breaking my ship.

ARIANNE
I'm the only reason this peice of junk can get off the ground.

ARIANNE flips several switches. A negative sounding beep responds.

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
(To herself)
Or not.

She tries again. Same negative beep

ARIANNE
[Negative] "Beep"? Your not supposed to [Negative] "Beep". You're supposed to [Positive] "Beep boop beep" when I start primary ignition.

ARIANNE run some diagnostics

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
Oh. That's not good.

INT. AKEEN SLUMS SAFEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

EKELLE
People are going to die!

DORUN
And there's nothing I can do about that now-

ARIANNE
(From communicator)
DORUN, we got a problem.

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
(From Crew Freighter)
Something is blocking engine startup. Looks like ships planet-wide are affected.

Worried look shared by DORUN/ELLIS

ELLIS
Imperial Inhibitor Tech.

DORUN
The situation is worse than I thought.

EKELLE
What's going on?

ELLIS
The Empire has overridden control of all ships on the planet. Only authorized Imperial ships are able to fly

EKELLE
That means-

DORUN
It means that the Empire is prepared for your revolt. They knew exactly when it was going to happen.

EKELLE
Thats... That's not possible.

DORUN
Possible? It's happening. Look on the bright side darling, it looks like we're going help you after all.
