FADE IN:

EXT. AKEEN, PLANET GULON II - DAY

Camera opens to a vaguely Middle Eastern city. Sun-bleached brick slums dominate the city, with impossibly high skyscapers in the background. Three militaristic troop transports fly past the camera.

The ships land in the clearing of a small open-air market in the slums. The ship doors open and soldiers with initimidating armored bodysuits storm out.

The soliders come to a door, surrounding it "SWAT" style. They breach and the camera follows as they clear room by room. Empty.

From the second story window, Dorun watches as the raid happens across the street. He turns towards his companions in the sparse, dusty room. Ekelle stands close, pensively watching the scene below. Ellis sits nearby, deep in thought. Tarsis keeps watch, leaned back against the wall watching the hallway through the slightly opened door.

DORUN
We have to get off this planet.

TARSIS
We got out just in time.

ELLIS
Dorun, if they are raiding our safehouse it means-

DORUN
(interuptting)
It means we have to get off this planet.

EKELLE
You can't just run now!

TARSIS
Ekelle is right. If we run now we trash months of work.

ELLIS
Months setting up to cripple the Empire here.

EKELLE
The Empire that took my family. That's why I joined the Rebellion-

DORUN
The Empire has taken something from all of us. And my crew and I haven't joined your Rebellion.

TARSIS
Do you know how much we'll be losing if we run now?

ELLIS
Not even counting bribes, we'll be abandoning contacts its taken months to establish.

TARSIS
I'm finally making headway with my black market connections.

DORUN
None of which matters if we're dead. Look I don't want to run any more than you lot do, but all this revolt is going to do is flush out the rebellion leaders. I've seen it before, if we stay we'll be caught- or dead- in a week.

DORUN (CONT'D)
(Speaking into a handheld communicator)
ARIANNE, get the ship ready. We're leaving.

CUT TO:

INT. CREW FREIGHTER

Cables and hardware are strewn about the run-down cockpit of the Crew Freighter. ARIANNE's head pops out from under the console she was in the process of fixing.

She scrambles to look for the communicator. Picking it up she attempts to sound calm and composed.

ARIANNE
(Hesitant)
Um. Yes Dorun. Right away.

She looks around at the mess.

ARIANNE
(Trailing off)
I'll get right on that.

DORUN
(From Communicator)
Have you been sleeping on the job?

ARIANNE
Hah! I haven't slept in days. I barely got the ignition coil working again and now the Nav console keeps losing power.

DORUN
You better not be breaking my ship.

ARIANNE
I'm the only reason this junker can even get off the ground.

ARIANNE flips several switches. A negative sounding beep responds.

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
(To herself)
Or not.

She tries again. Same negative beep

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
[Negative] "Beep"? Your not supposed to [Negative] "Beep". You're supposed to [Positive] "Beep boop beep" when I start primary ignition.

ARIANNE taps at the panel looking for the issue.

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
It can't be the Nav causing this. We have enough fuel... Ignition coil OK... Oh that's not good.

CUT TO:

INT. AKEEN SLUMS SAFEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

EKELLE
You said you would help us!

DORUN
I said I *could* help you, there's a difference.

ARIANNE
(From communicator)
Dorun, we have a problem. Something is blocking engine startup. Looks like ships planet-wide are affected.

Worried look shared by DORUN/ELLIS

ELLIS
Imperial Inhibitor Tech.

DORUN
The situation is worse than I thought.

EKELLE
What's going on?

ELLIS
The Empire has overridden control of all ships on the planet.

DORUN
Only authorized Imperial ships are able to fly.

EKELLE
That means-

DORUN
It means that the Empire knows all about your revolt.

EKELLE
Thats... That's not possible.

DORUN
Our safehouse gets raided the same day all ships on the planet are grounded? The Empire is making their move.

ELLIS
What do we do?

DORUN
What I've been saying all along. We have to get off this planet.

(Roll Title Credits)

INT. AKEEN SLUMS SAFEHOUSE

DORUN
So we have a planet about to tear itself apart, a ship that can't fly, and a well armed enemy between us and freedom. What do we do.

Silence.

DORUN (CON'T)
Well don't everyone speak at once.

TARSIS
Can we hack in and clear our ship for launch?

ELLIS
I have access codes that can get us into the Imperial network.

DORUN
Too suspicious. They'll have cruisers patrolling, we'll be shot down before we get into orbit.

EKELLE
I have to warn the others.

TARSIS
I say we go in blasters blazing.

ELLIS
[Condescending] Tarsis, [Lecturing] we won't get far if we just start shooting. We still have those Imperial uniforms from the Ikketar job. We could get into the Restricted Zone without firing a shot.

TARSIS
[Sarcastic] Ellis, The last time we used those uniforms I nearly got blasted at the first checkpoint!

ELLIS
Well if you hadn't called him a drunken Telosin maybe it wouldn't have blown our cover!

EKELLE
We can still save the rebellion but we have to act now!

DORUN
OI!

Everyone's attention snaps to DORUN

DORUN (CONT'D)
I've made my decision. And we're doing it your way.

ELLIS
Uh. Who's way?

DORUN
All of you.

TARSIS
Huh?

DORUN
(bemused)
We won't get far if we try and shoot our way in, but the uniforms will only get us past low security areas, so Tarsis, I guarantee you get to shoot something today.

Tarsis looks pleased.

EKELLE
But the rebel-

DORUN
(interuppting)
-The rebellion can help us help them. I assume whatever plan you had for this uprising includes having flyable ships?

Ekelle reluctantly nods.

DORUN
Then taking down that Inhibitor helps us both.

TARSIS
So... what are we gonna do?

DORUN
Ekelle, contact the rebellion. Tell them it's a trap and that if they want to be useful to meet us North of the Bazaar in one hour. We're going back to the ship to get ready.

ELLIS
Ready for what, exactly?

DORUN
The Empire's made their move, it's time we made ours.

TARSIS
There's an intergalactic army between us and that Inhibitor.

EKELLE
The rebellion doesn't trust you.

ELLIS
The odds of us succeeding are impossible.

DORUN
Perfect.

INT. CREW FREIGHTER: MAIN ROOM
The main room is cramped, lived-in, with a small cluttered table on one side and a cylindrical console on the other. Open to see Dorun dressed in an officers uniform. He looks slightly uncomfortable. Ellis beside him is dressed in an Imperial soldiers uniform. They size each other up.

ELLIS
You look terrible.

DORUN
These uniforms never did fit me.

Enter Tarsis, also in soldier uniform. He is heavily armed, comically so.

ELLIS
You must be joking.

TARSIS
What?

DORUN
One gun, Tarsis. You'll raise suspicion.

ELLIS
He'll raise hell.

Tarsis sniffs, but accepts. He pulls out a number of odd devices. laying out equipment on the table.

TARSIS
(Petuently)
Fine, but I am bringing these. Camo energy shield, sensor disruption grenade, and *this*.

Tarsis pulls out an UNKOWN GRENADE

ELLIS
What is it?

TARSIS
(with a childs wonder)
I have no idea. I got it off a arms dealer back on Ungvar IV.

ELLIS
And he didn't tell you what it was?

TARSIS
He... didn't get the chance.

ELLIS
You stole it

Tarsis sputters thinking of a lie

DORUN
He stole it.

ELLIS ^
He stole it.

Enter Ekelle with KURDEER.

DORUN
How did you get on my ship? How did you even know where my ship was?

EKELLE
Perhaps you should give the Resistance more credit.

DORUN
(To KURDEER)
We'll see. I don't like strangers on my ship.

KURDEER
I am Kurdeer.

DORUN
Well Kurdeer you can call me Dor-

KURDEER
(interuppting)
You are Dorun Ryzter Pepsis, owner of the cargo freighter *Windswift* and the legitimate commodity trading business you run from it. Of course, that's just a front for the blackmarket and mercenary operation you have.

DORUN
(to Ekelle)
Perhaps I *should* give your little rebellion more credit.

KURDEER
We know much, Captain Pepsis-

DORUN
I'm no captain. Call me Dorun.

KURDEER
As you wish, Dorun. Although now that I see this ship, I do not think Windswift is an appropriate name.

DORUN
She's faster than she looks!

KURDEER
I doubt that. Regardless, Ekelle has convinced me to meet with you.

TARSIS
Too late, the Empires already sprung their trap.

DORUN
I assume that our safehouse wasn't the only one raided?

KURDEER
True, many of our comrades have been captured. What's more concerning is our grounded ships. Ekelle says you can help us.

DORUN
We can help each other.

Dorun motions for everyone to gather around the cylindrical console. After punching a few buttons a 3D hologram appears suspended from the base of the console. The hologram shows 3D blueprints of a large facility. Different sections highlight in a loop, notes pointing to different rooms/sections.

DORUN
This is the Governor's Fortress. Since the Empire took control, this facility has become the center of government administration for the entire planet. If the Inhibitor is going to be anywhere, it will be here.

EKELLE
That complex is huge. The Inhibitor could be anywhere in there.

DORUN
An inhibitor that can stop ships planet-wide is going to be large. Very large. Also, it had to be installed quite recently or we would have seen the signs.

ELLIS
Has there been any large construction efforts near the Fortress?

DORUN
I don't know. We could only get blueprints from the initial construction.

TARSIS
So we don't know about any changes since it was built. Great.

KURDEER
But *we* do. We have been watching the Fortress for some time. On the west side, here **[points to blueprint]**, an extension to the spaceport is underway.

EKELLE
Security is high there. Too high for simple construction.

DORUN
That's it. I think I might be impressed after all.

TARSIS
So how do we get in?

DORUN
(To Kurdeer)
You're not going to like this.

Kurdeer eyes Dorun suspiciously.

[Commerical Break]

INT. CREW FREIGHTER: MAIN ROOM
Establishing shot of the Windswift in a crowded public shipyard. Cut to inside the main room of the ship.

KURDEER
(hostile)
You want us to do what!?

EKELLE
You really don't have any respect for us.

DORUN
It's the only way.

EKELLE
It's lunacy.

DORUN
It will work!

KURDEER
Let me get this straight. You want to us to march up to the Restricted Zone checkpoint and *get arrested*?

DORUN
Well, I'll be the one arresting you, but yes that's the jist.

KURDEER
Who do you think you are?

DORUN
The only one on this planet that can save your friends.

A long beat. Kurdeer and Ekelle share a look.

EKELLE
We'll do it.

KURDEER
What? Ekelle!

Kurdeer pulls Ekelle aside. A hushed, heated conversation ensues, words indistinguable. Body language shows Ekelle getting the upper hand. It's obvious they're "together".

Kurdeer aquiesces, turns back to group.

KURDEER
(begrudgingly)
Fine. We will be at the Bazaar. If this is some trick-

DORUN
It's not a trick. (To Ekelle) Thank you.

EKELLE
I am placing everything I hold dear into your hands. You know that.

DORUN
I know.

EKELLE
I hope you know what you're doing.

Close-up on Dorun

DORUN
(quietly, to himself)
Me too.

EXT. GULON II - RESTRICTED ZONE CHECKPOINT
The crew, Ekelle and Kurdeer, and a group of poorly dressed rebels arrive near the Retricted Zone Checkpoint. Due to it's proximity to the Checkpoint, a large open-air bazaar has formed. The bazaar is empty, despite teeming with fully stocked stalls- people have left in a hurry.

The group is stopped by Dorun around the corner from the Checkpoint proper.

DORUN
Around this corner is the checkpoint to the Restricted Zone. We have one shot at this. Let's make it count.

ELLIS
Any last words?

DORUN
Focus. This will work. Tarsis, show them how it's done.

Tarsis takes on the demeanor of a drill sargeant.

TARSIS
MOVE IT YOU SLOVENLY LOT. I HAVEN'T SEEN A SADDER DISPLAY OF PIGSLUGS IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. MOVE IT!

The rebel group is surprised, some taking offence.

TARSIS
(conspiratorially)
This won't work if you look like you're going to jump me, put your heads down and play the part... IF I SEE SO MUCH AS A FINGER OUT OF PLACE I'LL PERSONALLY RIP YOUR THROAT OUT.

ELLIS
(privately to Dorun)
He enjoys this a bit too much...

The group, led by the Imperial clothed crew march towards the checkpoint. The heavily entrenched checkpoint features several imperial soldiers and a very large gatehouse. The gates are closed, heavy weaponry ready, guards dot the various watchtowers and guardposts surrounding the area.

TARSIS
HALT!

An imperial trooper rushes towards the crew. He salutes Dorun.

CHECKPOINT GUARD
Sir! Apologies sir, we do not have your... arrival... on the order sheet, Officer _____?

DORUN
(haughty)
Never mind, soldier. I assume our carrier is ready.

CHECKPOINT GUARD
Uhh... sorry sir... uhh let me check with the Duty Officer.

DORUN
Perhaps you should. Be quick about it.

The soldier puts his hand to his ear communicator and calls it in.

CHECKPOINT GUARD
(To communicator)
Officer here... looking for transport... he didn't give me his name. (to Dorun) One moment sir, the duty officer is on his way.

An officer steps out of one of the larger guardposts. He appears very displeased as he tucks his top into his trousers and marches towards the group. Dorun turns quietly to Ellis

DORUN
We have a problem. He outranks me.

Ellis doesn't have time to react as the officer reaches the group.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
And just what is the meaning of this?

Dorun snaps to attention.

DORUN
Sir. Junior Dominant Reese Karsor reporting.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Junior Dominant Reese Karsor what the hell are you doing at my checkpoint and why the hell do you have these stinking slumrats with you?

Dorun looks at the rebels, seeing flashes of anger from the group he puts his hand on the officer's arm.

DORUN
(quietly)
Perhaps sir, it would be best if we chatted in private.

The officer casts a look of disgust across the rebels

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Yes. Very well Junior Dominant.

The Officer leads Dorun away to the exterior of the main guardhouse.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Well?

DORUN
Sir, my orders are to publicly arrest and transport those informants.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Informants?

DORUN
Yes sir, rebels that are considered assets by the Intelligence Dominance.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
I wasn't told of any transport.

DORUN
I'm not surprised. Intelligence Dominance is spread pretty thin.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
It's not just Intelligence, my checkpoint has been at half-strength for weeks.

DORUN
I don't know what they're thinking.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Don't worry. I was posted at Hyrus Seven. These Gulon's are cattle compared to them.

DORUN
I heard about Hyrus Seven. Violent.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
You just need to get them under the heel of your boot. Then you squeeze.

Dorun shakes off the disgust.

DORUN
Yes, well, my commanding officer wants our informants publicly arrests as to not arouse suspicion.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Just like Intelligence to waste time. Should just kill this lot as an example.

DORUN
My commanding officer would not be pleased.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Hah! I would expect not. Alright, well we'll get you through and you can be on your way.

DORUN
Uh... sir... I was informed we'd be given a troop transport to carry the informants.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
(exploding)
WHAT? We're at half-strength and they want to take more?

Cut to Ellis, Tarsis, and Checkpoint Guard watching the Checkpoint Officer yell at Dorun

ELLIS
This is not going well.

CHECKPOINT GUARD
Not so bad. Usually he throws things.

Ellis and Tarsis give a "wtf" look at the Guard. Cut back to Officer and Dorun
