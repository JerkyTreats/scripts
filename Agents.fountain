AGENTS OF THE EMPIRE

FADE IN:
EXT. AKEEN, PLANET GULON II - DAY
Camera opens to a vaguely Middle Eastern city. Brick slums dominate the city, with impossibly high skyscapers in the background. Smoke rises from sections of the slums.
Three militaristic spaceships fly past the camera, two troop carriers and gunship. Radio chatter is heard as they fly past.

EXT. AKEEN SLUMS, PLANET GULON II - CONTINUOUS
A woman in one of the slums streets looks overhead as the three ships fly by. She turns and enters a nondescript building and finds an office with several characters inside, a conversation already underway.

DORUN
We got to get off this planet.

EKELLE
Excuse me?

DORUN
Your "rebellion" is about to tear this planet apart.

EKELLE
This rebellion is trying to free this planet from the Empire. The same Empire you're trying to get away from.

DORUN
They haven't caught me yet. Joining some doomed rebellion sounds like a great way to get caught.

EKELLE
You and your crew have the ability to help us.

DORUN
Not now, I don't. If we had gotten here earlier, maybe. But not now.

EKELLE
You said you would help us.

DORUN
No, I said I could help you. There's a difference.

ELLIS
DORUN, do you know how much we'll be losing if we run now? Not even counting bribes, we'll be abandoning contacts its taken months to establish.

TARSIS
We're finally making headway with our black market connections.

DORUN
None of which matters if we're dead. Look I don't want to run any more than you lot do, but all this revolt is going to do is flush out the rebellion leaders. I've seen it before, they're playing right into the Empires hands

DORUN (CONT'D)
(Speaking into communicator)
ARIANNE, get the ship ready. We're leaving.

INT. CREW FREIGHTER
Cables and hardware are strewn about. ARIANNE's head pops out of a console she was in the process of "fixing".

She scrambles to look for the communicator. Picking it up she attempts to sound calm and composed.

ARIANNE
(Hesitant)
Um. Yes Dorun. Right away.

She looks around at the mess.

ARIANNE
(Trailing off)
I'll get right on that.

DORUN
(From Communicator)
Have you been sleeping on the job?

ARIANNE
This coming from you? I was just recalibrating the Nav.

DORUN
You better not be breaking my ship.

ARIANNE
Hey I'm the only reason this peice of junk can still get off the ground.

ARIANNE flips several switches. A negative sounding beep responds.

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
(To herself)
Or not.

She tries again. Same negative beep

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
[Negative] "Beep"? Your not supposed to [Negative] "Beep". You're supposed to [Positive] "Beep boop beep" when I start primary ignition.

ARIANNE run some diagnostics

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
Oh. That's not good.

INT. AKEEN SLUMS SAFEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

EKELLE
People are going to die!

DORUN
And there's nothing I can do about that now-

ARIANNE
(From communicator)
DORUN, we got a problem.

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
(From Crew Freighter)
Something is blocking engine startup. Looks like ships planet-wide are affected.

Worried look shared by DORUN/ELLIS

ELLIS
Imperial Inhibitor Tech.

DORUN
The situation is worse than I thought.

EKELLE
What's going on?

ELLIS
The Empire has overridden control of all ships on the planet. Only authorized Imperial ships are able to fly

EKELLE
That means-

DORUN
It means that the Empire is prepared for your revolt. They knew exactly when it was going to happen.

EKELLE
Thats... That's not possible.

DORUN
Possible? It's happening. Look on the bright side darling, it looks like we're going help you after all.

(Roll Title Credits)

INT. AKEEN SLUMS SAFEHOUSE

DORUN
So we have a planet about to tear itself apart, a ship that can't fly, and an intergalactic army between us and freedom. What do we do.

Concerned looks shared across the room.

DORUN (CON'T)
Well don't everyone talk at once.

EKELLE
If the Empire really is as prepared as you say, I have to warn the others.

TARSIS
I say we go in blasters blazing.

ELLIS
Tarsis, we won't get far if we just start shooting. We still have those Imperial uniforms. We could get through the Restricted Zone without firing a shot.

TARSIS
The last time we used those uniforms I nearly got my head shot off at the first checkpoint!

ELLIS
Well if you hadn't called him a drunken Telosin maybe it wouldn't have blown our cover!

EKELLE
We can still save this rebellion but only if we act now!

DORUN
OI!

Everyone's attention snaps to DORUN

DORUN (CONT'D)
I've made my decision. And we're doing it your way.

ELLIS
Uh. Who's way?

DORUN
Yes.

TARSIS
You care to make any sense?

DORUN
(bemused)
We won't get far if we try and shoot our way in, but the uniforms we have will only let us bypass low security areas with everyone on high alert.

EKELLE
But the rebel-

DORUN
-The rebellion won't be left to die. Anyone courageous enough to take on the Empire deserves better than being led to the slaughterhouse.

TARSIS
So... what then?

DORUN
Ekelle, contact the rebellion. Tell them it's a trap and
