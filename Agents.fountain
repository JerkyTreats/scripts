FADE IN:

EXT. AKEEN, PLANET GULON II - DAY

Camera opens to a vaguely Middle Eastern city. Brick slums dominate the city, with impossibly high skyscapers in the background. Smoke rises from sections of the slums.
Three militaristic spaceships fly past the camera, two troop carriers and gunship. Radio chatter is heard as they fly past.

EXT. AKEEN SLUMS, PLANET GULON II

A woman in one of the slums streets looks overhead as the three ships fly by. She turns and enters a nondescript building and finds an office with several characters inside, a conversation already underway.

DORUN
We got to get off this planet.

EKELLE
Excuse me?

DORUN
Your "rebellion" is about to tear this planet apart.

EKELLE
This rebellion is trying to free this planet from the Empire. The same Empire you're trying to get away from.

DORUN
They haven't caught me yet. Joining some doomed rebellion sounds like a great way to get caught.

EKELLE
You and your crew have the ability to help us.

DORUN
Not now, I don't. If we had gotten here earlier, maybe. But not now.

EKELLE
You said you would help us.

DORUN
No, I said I could help you. There's a difference.

ELLIS
DORUN, do you know how much we'll be losing if we run now? Not even counting bribes, we'll be abandoning contacts its taken months to establish.

TARSIS
We're finally making headway with our black market connections.

DORUN
None of which matters if we're dead. Look I don't want to run any more than you lot do, but all this revolt is going to do is flush out the rebellion leaders. I've seen it before, they're playing right into the Empires hands

DORUN (CONT'D)
(Speaking into communicator)
ARIANNE, get the ship ready. We're leaving.

CUT TO:

INT. CREW FREIGHTER

Cables and hardware are strewn about. ARIANNE's head pops out of a console she was in the process of "fixing".

She scrambles to look for the communicator. Picking it up she attempts to sound calm and composed.

ARIANNE
(Hesitant)
Um. Yes Dorun. Right away.

She looks around at the mess.

ARIANNE
(Trailing off)
I'll get right on that.

DORUN
(From Communicator)
Have you been sleeping on the job?

ARIANNE
This coming from you? I was just recalibrating the Nav.

DORUN
Again? You better not be breaking my ship.

ARIANNE
I'm the only reason this junker can even get off the ground.

ARIANNE flips several switches. A negative sounding beep responds.

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
(To herself)
Or not.

She tries again. Same negative beep

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
[Negative] "Beep"? Your not supposed to [Negative] "Beep". You're supposed to [Positive] "Beep boop beep" when I start primary ignition.

ARIANNE run some diagnostics

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
Oh. That's not good.

CUT TO:

INT. AKEEN SLUMS SAFEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

EKELLE
People are going to die!

DORUN
And there's nothing I can do about that now-

ARIANNE
(From communicator)
DORUN, we got a problem.

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
(From Crew Freighter)
Something is blocking engine startup. Looks like ships planet-wide are affected.

Worried look shared by DORUN/ELLIS

ELLIS
Imperial Inhibitor Tech.

DORUN
The situation is worse than I thought.

EKELLE
What's going on?

ELLIS
The Empire has overridden control of all ships on the planet. Only authorized Imperial ships are able to fly

EKELLE
That means-

DORUN
It means that the Empire is prepared for your revolt. They knew exactly when it was going to happen.

EKELLE
Thats... That's not possible.

DORUN
Possible? It's happening. Look on the bright side darling, it looks like we're going help you after all.

(Roll Title Credits)

INT. AKEEN SLUMS SAFEHOUSE

DORUN
So we have a planet about to tear itself apart, a ship that can't fly, and a prepared enemy between us and freedom. What do we do.

Silence.

DORUN (CON'T)
Well don't everyone talk at once.

ELLIS
We might be able to hack in and clear our ship for launch.

DORUN
No, an unmarked shipped suddenly given Imperial access will be suspicious. They must have cruisers in orbit as we speak. We'll be ripped apart before we breach atmosphere.

EKELLE
If the Empire really is as prepared as you say, I have to warn the others.

TARSIS
I say we go in blasters blazing.

ELLIS
Tarsis, we won't get far if we just start shooting. We still have those Imperial uniforms. We could get through the Restricted Zone without firing a shot.

TARSIS
The last time we used those uniforms I nearly got my head shot off at the first checkpoint!

ELLIS
Well if you hadn't called him a drunken Telosin maybe it wouldn't have blown our cover!

EKELLE
We can still save this rebellion but only if we act now!

DORUN
OI!

Everyone's attention snaps to DORUN

DORUN (CONT'D)
I've made my decision. And we're doing it your way.

ELLIS
Uh. Who's way?

DORUN
Yes.

TARSIS
You care to make any sense?

DORUN
(bemused)
We won't get far if we try and shoot our way in, but the uniforms will only get us past low security areas.

EKELLE
But the rebel-

DORUN
-The rebellion won't be left to die. Anyone courageous enough to take on the Empire deserves better than being led to the slaughterhouse.

TARSIS
So... what then?

DORUN
Ekelle, contact the rebellion. Tell them it's a trap and that if they want to be useful to meet us North of the Bazaar in one hour. We're going back to the ship to get those uniforms and arm ourselves.

ELLIS
What's your plan?

DORUN
The Empire is expecting to win. So we're going to give it to them and it's going to let us walk right in.

TARSIS
There's an intergalactic army between us and that Inhibitor.

EKELLE
The rebellion doesn't trust you.

ELLIS
The odds of us pulling this off is impossible.

DORUN
Perfect.

INT. CREW FREIGHTER: MAIN ROOM
Open to see Dorun dressed in an officers uniform. He looks slightly uncomfortable. Ellis beside him is dressed in an Imperial soldiers uniform. They size each other up.

ELLIS
You look terrible.

DORUN
These uniforms never did fit me.

Enter Tarsis, also in soldier uniform. He is heavily armed, comically so.

ELLIS
You must be joking.

TARSIS
What?

DORUN
One gun, Tarsis. You'll raise suspicion.

ELLIS
He'll raise hell.

Tarsis sniffs, but accepts. He pulls out a Grav Grenade with a mischevious grin.

TARSIS
Fine, but I __am__ bringing this.

ELLIS
What is it?

TARSIS
(with a childs wonder)
I have no idea. I got it off a arms dealer back on Ungvar IV.

ELLIS
And he didn't tell you what it was?

TARSIS
He... didn't get the chance.

ELLIS
You stole it

Tarsis tries to think of a lie

DORUN & ELLIS
He stole it.

Tarsis puffs up

TARSIS
Well we'll find out what it does soon enough.  Doesn't matter anyways, seeing as how we're all about to die.

Ugly pause.

ELLIS
(hesitant)
Dorun, I don't think this is going to work. Usually we plan months in advance for something half as dangerous. We haven't considered all the possibilities.

Tarsis and Ellis look to Dorun. Dorun pauses, trying to find the right words to encourage his friends.

DORUN
We haven't considered all the possibilities. And, it's quite likely we're going to die today. But the Empire has taken so much from all of us...

Tarsis flashes anger, Ellis sadness.

DORUN (CON'T)
...And we have to fight back. We have to stand up and fight. Even if we die doing it. This plan will work. It has to work. It's a bit rough, and it's going to take some improvisation, but we are very good at what we do. And they have no idea we're coming for them.

Tarsis and Ellis show determiniation, they are ready.
