FADE IN

EXT. AKEEN CITY, PLANET GULON II - HIGH NOON

Camera opens to a vaguely Middle Eastern city. Sun-bleached brick slums dominate the majority of the frame, with impossibly high glass skyscapers in the background. As the camera pans over the city, three militaristic troop transports fly past.

CUT TO:

EXT. SMALL MARKET, AKEEN SLUMS - SAME TIME

The ships land in the clearing of an abandoned open-air market in the slums. The ship doors open and soldiers with initimidating armored bodysuits storm out, heading down one of the cramped alleys.

CUT TO:

EXT. TENAMENT BUILDING, AKEEN SLUMS - SAME TIME

The soliders come to a door, surrounding it "SWAT" style. They breach and the camera follows as they clear room by room. Empty.

CUT TO:

INT. CREW SAFEHOUSE, AKEEN SLUMS - SAME TIME

From a second story window across the street, DORUN watches the raid. He turns towards his companions in the sparse, dusty room. The camera pans to see EKELLE standing close, pensively watching the scene below. ELLIS sits nearby, hands clasped in front of him deep in thought. TARSIS is alert, leaned back against the wall watching through the slightly ajar door. The camera lands back on Dorun.

DORUN
We have to get off this planet.

TARSIS
We got out just in time.

ELLIS
Dorun, if they're raiding our safehouse it means-

DORUN
It means we have to get off this planet.

EKELLE
This is a setback, yes, but you can't just run.

TARSIS
Ekelle is right. If we run now we trash months of work setting up to cripple the Empires' control on Gulon Two.

EKELLE
The Empire that took my family. The Rebellion can help-

DORUN
The Empire has taken something from all of us. And we're not part of your Rebellion.

ELLIS
Do you know how much we'll be losing if we run now? Not even counting bribes, we'll be abandoning contacts its taken months to establish.

TARSIS
I'm finally making headway with my black market connections.

DORUN
None of which matters if we're dead. Look I don't want to run any more than you lot do, but we just got very lucky. It's only a matter of time before they connect the dots about us. I don't plan on being here when they do.

Dorun pulls a small handheld communicator out of his pocket.

DORUN (CONT'D)
Arianne, get the ship ready. We're leaving.

CUT TO:

INT. SHIP: WINDSWIFT; COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Cables, tools and hardware are strewn about the run-down cockpit of the Crew Freighter. ARIANNE's head pops out from under the console she was in the process of fixing.

Arianne curses as she tries to find the communicator amid the mess. Picking it up she attempts to sound calm and composed.

ARIANNE
Yes, Dorun. Right away.

She looks around at the mess.

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
I'll get right on that...

DORUN
(From Communicator)
Have you been sleeping on the job?

ARIANNE
Excuse me? I haven't slept in days. I barely got the ignition coil working again and now the Nav console keeps losing power.

DORUN
You better not be breaking my ship.

ARIANNE
I'm the only reason this junker can even get off the ground.

ARIANNE flips several switches. A negative sounding "wump" responds.

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
Or not.

She tries again. Same negative Wump

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
"Wump"? You're not supposed to "Wump". When I start primary ignition you go "Dee-Dee-Deep".

ARIANNE taps at the panel looking for the issue.

ARIANNE (CONT'D)
It can't be the Nav causing this. We have enough fuel. Ignition coil OK. Oh. Oh that's not good.

CUT TO:

INT. CREW SAFEHOUSE, AKEEN SLUMS - SAME TIME

EKELLE
You said you would help us!

DORUN
I said I *could* help you, there's a difference.

ARIANNE
(From communicator)
Dorun, we have a problem. Something is blocking engine startup.

Pause

ARIANNE (CON'T)
All ships on the planet are affected.

Worried look shared by DORUN/ELLIS

ELLIS
Imperial Inhibitor Tech.

DORUN
The situation is worse than I thought.

EKELLE
What's going on?

ELLIS
The Empire has overridden control of all ships on the planet.

DORUN
Only authorized Imperial ships are able to fly.

EKELLE
That means-

DORUN
It means that the Empire knows all about your revolt.

EKELLE
Thats... That's not possible.

DORUN
Our safehouse gets raided the same day all ships on the planet are grounded? The Empire is making their move.

ELLIS
What do we do?

DORUN
What I've been saying all along. We have to get off this planet.

(Roll Title Credits)

INT. AKEEN SLUMS SAFEHOUSE

DORUN
So we have a planet about to tear itself apart, a ship that can't fly, and a well armed enemy between us and freedom. What do we do.

Silence.

DORUN (CON'T)
Well don't everyone speak at once.

TARSIS
Can we hack in and clear our ship for launch?

ELLIS
I have access codes that can get us into the Imperial network.

DORUN
Too suspicious. They'll have cruisers patrolling, we'll be shot down before we get into orbit.

EKELLE
I have to warn the others.

TARSIS
I say we go in blasters blazing.

ELLIS
[Condescending] Tarsis, [Lecturing] we won't get far if we just start shooting. We still have those Imperial uniforms from the Ikketar job. We could get into the Restricted Zone without firing a shot.

TARSIS
[Sarcastic] Ellis, The last time we used those uniforms I nearly got blasted at the first checkpoint!

ELLIS
Well if you hadn't called him a drunken Telosin maybe it wouldn't have blown our cover!

EKELLE
We can still save the rebellion but we have to act now!

DORUN
OI!

Everyone's attention snaps to DORUN

DORUN (CONT'D)
I've made my decision. And we're doing it your way.

ELLIS
Uh. Who's way?

DORUN
All of yours.

TARSIS
Huh?

DORUN
We won't get far if we try and shoot our way in, but the uniforms will only get us past low security areas, so Tarsis, I guarantee you get to shoot something today.

Tarsis looks pleased.

EKELLE
But the rebel-

DORUN
(interuppting)
-The rebellion can help us help them. I assume whatever plan you had for this uprising includes having flyable ships?

Ekelle reluctantly nods.

DORUN
Then taking down that Inhibitor helps us both.

TARSIS
So... what are we gonna do?

DORUN
Ekelle, contact the rebellion. Tell them it's a trap and that if they want to be useful to meet us North of the Bazaar in one hour. We're going back to the ship to get ready.

ELLIS
Ready for what, exactly?

DORUN
The Empire's made their move, it's time we made ours.

TARSIS
There's an intergalactic army between us and that Inhibitor.

EKELLE
The rebellion doesn't trust you.

ELLIS
We have no time to prepare for this plan.

DORUN
(confident)
Perfect.

INT. SHIP: WINDSWIFT; MAIN ROOM
The main room is cramped, lived-in, with a small cluttered table on one side and a cylindrical console on the other. Open to see Dorun dressed in an officers uniform. He looks slightly uncomfortable. Ellis beside him is dressed in Imperial soldiers armor. They size each other up.

ELLIS
You look terrible.

DORUN
These uniforms never did fit me.

Enter Tarsis, also in soldier uniform. He is heavily armed, comically so.

ELLIS
You must be joking.

TARSIS
What?

DORUN
One gun, Tarsis. You'll raise suspicion.

ELLIS
He'll raise hell.

Tarsis sniffs, but accepts. He pulls out a number of odd devices. laying out equipment on the table.

TARSIS
(Petuently)
Fine, but I am bringing these. Camo energy shield, sensor disruption grenade, and *this*.

Tarsis pulls out an UNKNOWN GRENADE

ELLIS
What is it?

TARSIS
(with a childs wonder)
I have no idea. I got it off a arms dealer back on Ungvar IV.

ELLIS
And he didn't tell you what it was?

TARSIS
He... didn't get the chance.

ELLIS
You stole it.

Tarsis sputters thinking of a lie

DORUN
He stole it.

ELLIS ^
He stole it.

Enter Ekelle with KURDEER.

DORUN
How did you get on my ship? How did you even know where my ship was?

EKELLE
Perhaps you should give the Resistance more credit.

DORUN
(To KURDEER)
We'll see. I don't like strangers on my ship.

KURDEER
I am Kurdeer.

DORUN
Well Kurdeer you can call me Dor-

KURDEER
(interuppting)
You are Dorun Pepsis Ryzer, owner of the cargo freighter *Windswift* and the legitimate commodity trading business you run from it. Of course, that's just a front for the blackmarket and mercenary operation you run.

DORUN
(to Ekelle)
You know my middle name. Ellis doesn't even know my middle name. Perhaps I *should* give your little rebellion more credit.

KURDEER
We know much, Captain Pepsis-

DORUN
I'm no captain. Call me Dorun.

KURDEER
As you wish, Dorun. Although now that I see this ship, I do not think Windswift is an appropriate name.

DORUN
She's faster than she looks!

KURDEER
I doubt that. Regardless, Ekelle has convinced me to meet with you.

TARSIS
Too late, the Empires already sprung their trap.

DORUN
I assume that our safehouse wasn't the only one raided?

KURDEER
Many of our comrades have been captured. What's more concerning is our grounded ships. Ekelle says you can help us.

DORUN
We can help each other.

Dorun motions for everyone to gather around the cylindrical console. After punching a few buttons a 3D hologram appears suspended from the base of the console. The hologram shows 3D blueprints of a large facility. Different sections highlight in a loop, notes pointing to different rooms/sections.

DORUN
This is the Governor's Fortress. Since the Empire took control, this facility has become the center of government administration for the entire planet. If the Inhibitor is going to be anywhere, it will be here.

EKELLE
That complex is huge. The Inhibitor could be anywhere in there.

DORUN
An inhibitor that can stop ships planet-wide is going to be large. Very large. Also, it would have to be installed quite recently or we would have seen the signs.

ELLIS
Has there been any large construction efforts near the Fortress?

DORUN
I don't know. We could only get blueprints from the initial construction.

TARSIS
So we don't know about any changes since it was built. Great.

KURDEER
But *we* do. We have been watching the Fortress for some time. On the west side, here **[points to blueprint]**, an extension to the spaceport is underway.

EKELLE
Security is high there. Too high for simple construction.

DORUN
That's it. I think I might be impressed after all.

TARSIS
So how do we get in?

DORUN
(To Kurdeer)
You're not going to like this.

Kurdeer eyes Dorun suspiciously.

[Commerical Break]

INT. CREW FREIGHTER: MAIN ROOM

Establishing shot of the Windswift in a crowded public shipyard. Cut to inside the main room of the ship.

KURDEER
(hostile)
You want us to do what!?

EKELLE
You really don't have any respect for us.

DORUN
It's the only way.

EKELLE
It's lunacy.

DORUN
It will work!

KURDEER
Let me get this straight. You want to us to march up to the Restricted Zone checkpoint and *get arrested*?

DORUN
Well, I'll be the one arresting you, but yeah that's the jist.

KURDEER
Who do you think you are?

DORUN
The only one on this planet that can get your ships off the ground.

A long beat. Kurdeer and Ekelle share a look.

EKELLE
We'll do it.

KURDEER
What? Ekelle! He can't be trusted!

Kurdeer pulls Ekelle aside. A hushed, heated conversation ensues, words indistinguable. Body language shows Ekelle getting the upper hand. It's obvious they're "together".

Kurdeer aquiesces, turns back to group.

KURDEER
(begrudgingly)
Fine. We will be at the Bazaar. If this is some trick-

DORUN
It's not a trick. (To Ekelle) Thank you.

EKELLE
Tell me, truthfully. Will this work?

DORUN
It has to.

EXT. GULON II - RESTRICTED ZONE CHECKPOINT

Dorun, Ellis, and Tarsis meet Ekelle and Kurdeer in a large bazaar. Despite fully stocked stalls, the bazaar is abandoned.

TARSIS
Where is everyone?

ELLIS
People smell trouble. Only fools would be out here when the Empire cracks down.

TARSIS
Including us?

ELLIS
Especially us.

DORUN
Ekelle, Kurdeer. I see you're here but where are your rebel friends?

EKELLE
You only see them when you want to see them.

Ekelle motions with her hand. Around the group several poorly dressed rebels appear from nowhere.

DORUN
Very good. My officer alias should get us through the checkpoint. With any luck we'll walk right through.

ELLIS
And if we don't have any luck?

Dorun gives Ellis a look.

DORUN
We improvise. Tarsis, show them how it's done.

Tarsis takes on the demeanor of a drill sargeant.

TARSIS
MOVE IT YOU SLOVENLY LOT. I HAVEN'T SEEN A SADDER DISPLAY OF SLUMRATS IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. MOVE IT!

The rebel group is surprised, some taking offence.

TARSIS
(conspiratorially)
This won't work if it looks like you're going to jump me, put your heads down and play the part... AND IF I SEE SO MUCH AS A FINGER OUT OF PLACE I'LL PERSONALLY RIP YOUR THROAT OUT.

ELLIS
(privately to Dorun)
He enjoys this a bit too much...

The group, led by the Imperial-disguised crew march towards the checkpoint. The heavily entrenched area features several imperial soldiers and very large gates. The gates are closed, guards dot the various watchtowers surrounding the area. A main guardhouse sit behind fortified heavy weaponry.

TARSIS
HALT!

An imperial trooper rushes towards the crew. He salutes Dorun.

CHECKPOINT GUARD
Sir! Apologies sir, we do not have your arrival on the order sheet, Officer _____?

DORUN
(haughty, a bit forced)
Never mind, soldier. I assume our transport is ready.

Ellis and Tarsis share a look. "Really, that's your Officer voice?"

CHECKPOINT GUARD
Uhh... sorry sir... uhh... let me check with the Duty Officer.

Dorun shares a look with Ellis/Tarsis

DORUN
Very well.

The soldier puts his hand to his ear communicator and calls it in.

CHECKPOINT GUARD
(To communicator)
Officer here... looking for transport... didn't give me his name.   (to Dorun) One moment sir, the officer is on his way.

A rotund officer steps out of the main guardhouse. Red cheeks snarl as he tucks his top into his trousers and marches towards the group. Dorun turns quietly to Ellis.

DORUN
(quietly)
We have a problem. He outranks me.

Ellis doesn't have time to react as the officer reaches the group.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
What the hell is this?

Dorun snaps to attention.

DORUN
Sir. Junior Dominant Reese Karsor reporting.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Junior Dominant Reese Karsor what the hell are you doing at my checkpoint? And why the hell do you have these stinking slumrats with you?

Dorun looks at the rebels, seeing flashes of anger from the group he puts his hand on the officer's arm.

DORUN
(quietly, respectfully)
Perhaps sir, it would be best if we chatted in private.

The officer casts a look of disgust across the rebels

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Come.

The Officer leads Dorun his private office in the main guardhouse. The office is well furnished. Hand-sized native statues stand on a cabinent on one of the walls. As the officer leans on his main desk, Dorun goes to the statues.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Well?

DORUN
These are original Gulonese ritual statues, aren't they?

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Cut the crap, Junior Dominant.

Dorun leans back against the cabinet.

DORUN
Sir, my orders are to publicly arrest and transport those informants.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Informants?

DORUN
Yes sir, rebels considered assets by the Intelligence Division.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
If they're "assets" why arrest them?

DORUN
My guess, sir, is to maintain their cover.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Just like Intelligence to waste my time.

DORUN
Yes sir.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
So you've come to my checkpoint with a dozen rebels on some halfbaked plan to arrest them?

DORUN
Thats... Exactly right, sir.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Wasted effort. These Gulon's are cattle. I was posted at Hyrus Seven. Now *they* were something.

DORUN
I heard about Hyrus Seven. Violent.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
These fringe planets are all the same. You just need to get the natives under the heel of your boot. Then you squeeze.

Dorun shakes off the disgust. Checkpoint Officer frowns, smelling weakness. He shifts off the desk he was leaning against and moves slightly closer to Dorun.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
(menacingly)
Where are you stationed out of, Junior Dominant?

DORUN
(hesitant)
Central Planets... mostly... This is my first tour on the Outer Rim.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
You soft Centralites. That's what I hate. I've been out here for years.

DORUN
Yes... Sir-

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
I'm not finished! You Centralites are all the same. Cozy posts on safe planets, only coming out here to sniff out a promotion. I'm bringing civilization to these savages. What have you done?

DORUN
I'm just following orders, sir.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
Well I'm giving you an order to get out of my sight!

DORUN
Sir... I'd be happy to, as soon as you give us a troop transport.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER
(exploding)
WHAT? You think I'm going to give you one of MY transports?

The officer gets closer to Dorun.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER (CON'T)
You impetuant little man. Do you have any idea who I am?

The officer is getting closer. A closeup shot shows Dorun's hand groping for one of the statues, his eyes remaining on the Officer. The officer is breathing down Dorun's neck.

CHECKPOINT OFFICER (CON'T)
I'll have you buried Junior Dominant, you hear me, buried!

Dorun swings the statue across the head of the Officer. He's unconscious before he hits the ground. Dorun rushes to the door, listening to see if anyone outside heard. Satisfied, he goes to the console on the main desk, authorizing a transport. Dorun moves to the Officer, taking a keycard and a communicator. He takes a moment to compose himself.

DORUN
Looks like you'll be the one buried.

Dorun leaves the office, closing the door before returning to the group.

DORUN
The transport is being readied now. (To guard) Oh, private, your officer says he's not to be disturbed. He didn't seem to be in a very good mood, so I suggest you listen.

The guard is well aware of his Officer's temper.

CHECKPOINT GUARD
Yes sir.

The guard leaves and returns to his post. As the large gate doors open, Dorun turns to the group.

ELLIS
(quietly)
What happened?

DORUN
(quietly)
I improvised.

Behind the gates a landing port for small ships sits with a number of troop transports. One is being prepped for launch. The group approaches the ship.

DORUN (CON'T)
We don't have much time. You still know how to fly those things right?

Dorun motions to the transport.

ELLIS
Well I'm no ace pilot like Arianne, but I can fly it.

DORUN
You'll have to. We'll need this transport to get back our ship.

ELLIS
And the pilot already assigned to fly it?

DORUN
He'll have to be removed.

ELLIS
How are we supposed to do that?

DORUN
You mean how are *you* supposed to do it. Figure it out.

Ellis blanches, but covers it quickly. Tarsis directs the rebels into the rear section, closing the doors. Dorun, Ellis and Tarsis get in the front.

INT. TROOP TRANSPORT COCKPIT

The cockpit features four seats two by two. The pilot is in the left front seat, Ellis takes the seat beside him, Dorun and Tarsis sit in the backseats.

PILOT
Destination?

DORUN
Governor's Fortress.

PILOT
Ay ay.

The ship takes off. Well into the flight, Ellis looks back at Dorun, his expression "do I have to?". Dorun replies with a "Get on with it" expression. Tarsis frowns with a "what are you two talking about?" expression. Ellis turns to the Pilot.

ELLIS
Ah... We... We need you to wait for us once we land.

PILOT
What are you talking about? That's not protocol.

Dorun shoots Ellis with a "Not good enough" expression. Ellis considers his options. He moves to speak again, but stops before saying anything. He grows frustrated, then realizes what he's going to do. He looks to Dorun, then the Pilot.

ELLIS
(To Pilot)
Sorry about this.

PILOT
What?

Ellis punches the Pilot hard. The transport lurches, in the back the rebels fall over with the unexpected change in course. The Pilot tries to grab Ellis, who attempts to strike the pilot again. The Pilot fends off the attack, getting a decent hold on Ellis and pulls him down. From his viewpoint, Ellis sees an "Eject" lever. Ellis breaks from the Pilots grip, strikes again, then puts both hands on the lever. The pilot looks down, realizing what Ellis is going to do. He looks back up to Ellis, giving him a pleading look.

Ellis pulls the lever. The Pilots chair explodes laterally from his side of the ship. The other seats are unaffected. The room roars as air rushes in the cockpit. Ellis stuggles to get the ship back under control. He finally gets the ship back on course and puts on the comm helmet.

CUT TO:

INT. FLIGHT CONTROL CENTER, GOVERNORS FORTRESS

Flight Control on Gulon II has always been lacking, but the last several weeks have been particular bad with long days and few breaks. Flight Control isn't a hard job, mostly tedious, so the message that a Troop Transport has just had an ejection event sparks mild interest in an otherwise exhausted Flight Controller.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Transport Three-Seven-Two this is Flight Control. We just detected an ejection event on your ship, please respond.

[For the remainder of the conversation, the camera cuts to Flight Control and Transport Cockpit]

Ellis is startled, not exactly sure what to do.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
I say again, we've detected someone ejecting from your ship. Please respond.

ELLIS
Uh.. This is transport Three-Seven-Two... Everything is fine here, I don't know what you're talking about.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Transport Three-Seven-Two your ship has clearly logged an ejection event. You're also showing significant yaw drag.

ELLIS
No, no ejection here. Your sensors must be off.

The Flight Controller scoffs.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Our sensors are working just fine. You-

ELLIS
Look I don't know what to tell you. I would know if someone ejected.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Your ship must be logging bad flight data.

Ellis struggles at the controls, the ejection hole has produced significant drag.

ELLIS
If you say so, she's running smooth on my end.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Transport Three-Seven-Two you're hereby ordered to Shipyard B-Seven-Alpha for immediate diagnostics and repair.

ELLIS
Right after I finish this mission.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Sir when Flight Control gives you an order, you follow it immediately.

ELLIS
Sorry maam, I've got work to do.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
Why I have never- Transport Three-Seven-Two I will have you written up so fast-

ELLIS
You know what, write me up. You people are always-

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
*You People?*

ELLIS
Yeah. You People. You think you can just tell me whatever you want me to do and I'll do it. Well guess what Lady-

FLIGHT CONTROLLER
(incensed)
Oh you do *not* refer to me as Lady.

ELLIS
I just did!

Tarsis leans to Dorun as Ellis continues to tell the Flight Controller off.

TARSIS
He enjoys this a bit too much...

ELLIS
So *deal with it*.

To punctuate his point, Ellis pulls off the helmet communicator and tosses out the ejection hole.

DORUN
What the hell was that?

ELLIS
Improvising.
