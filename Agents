FADE IN:
EXT. AKEEN, PLANET GULON II - DAY
Camera opens to a vaguely Middle Eastern city. Brick slums dominate the city, with impossibly high skyscapers in the background. Smoke rises from sections of the slums.
Three militaristic spaceships fly past the camera, two troop carriers and gunship. Radio chatter is heard as they fly past.

EXT. AKEEN SLUMS, PLANET GULON II - CONTINUOUS
A woman in one of the slums streets looks overhead as the three ships fly by. She turns and enters a nondescript building and finds an office with several characters inside, a conversation already underway.

PROTAGONIST
We got to get off this planet.

REBEL LIASON
Excuse me?

PROTAGONIST
Your "rebellion" is about to tear this planet apart.

REBEL LIASON
This rebellion is trying to free this planet from the Empire. The same Empire you're trying to get away from.

PROTAGONIST
They haven't caught me yet. Joining some doomed rebellion sounds like a great way to get caught.

REBEL LIASON
You and your crew have the ability to help us.

PROTAGONIST
Not now, I don't. If we had gotten here earlier, maybe. But not now.

REBEL LIASON
You said you would help us.

PROTAGONIST
No, I said I could help you. There's a difference.

PRACTICAL FOIL
Protagonist, do you know how much we'll be losing if we run now? Not even counting bribes, we'll be abandoning contacts its taken months to establish.

PRACTICAL FOIL SUPPORT
We're finally making headway with our black market connections.

PROTAGONIST
None of which matters if we're dead. Look I don't want to run any more than you lot do, but all this revolt is going to do is flush out the rebellion leaders. I've seen it before, they're playing right into the Empires hands

PROTAGONIST (CONT'D)
(Speaking into communicator)
Pilot, get the ship ready. We're leaving.

INT. CREW FREIGHTER
Pilot is fully reclined in his chair. The communicator clearly shocks Pilot awake.

PILOT
(Enthusiastic)
Yes... Yes sir.

PROTAGONIST
(From Communicator)
What have I told you about sleeping on the job?

PILOT
(To himself)
You would know.
Pilot flips several switches. A negative sounding beep responds.

PILOT (CONT'D)
[Negative] "Beep"? Your not supposed to [Negative] "Beep". You're supposed to [Positive] "Beep boop beep" when I start primary ignition.

Pilot run some diagnostics

PILOT (CONT'D)
Oh. That's not good.

INT. AKEEN SLUMS SAFEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

REBEL LIASON
People are going to die!

PROTAGONIST
And there's nothing I can do about that now-

PILOT
(From communicator)
Protagonist, we got a problem.

PILOT (CONT'D)
(From Crew Freighter)
Something is blocking engine startup. Looks like ships planet-wide are affected.
Pilot/Practical Foil exchange worried look

PRACTICAL FOIL
Imperial Inhibitor Tech.

PROTAGONIST
The situation is worse than I thought.

REBEL LIASON
What's going on?

PRACTICAL FOIL
The Empire has overridden control of all ships on the planet. Only authorized Imperial ships are able to get off this planet

REBEL LIASON
That means-

PROTAGONIST
It means that the Empire is prepared for your revolt. They knew exactly when it was going to happen.

REBEL LIASON
Thats... That's not possible.

PROTAGONIST
Possible? It's happening. Look on the bright side darling, it looks like we're going help you after all.
